&lt;li&gt;Fed policies could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But lets say I didn&amp;#39;t want to invest in a fund that uses rolling future contracts to gain exposure but invest in the producers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil is easy, you don&amp;#39;t have to invest in USO you can invest in oil  companies (exxon , Shell, BP, chevron)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However what can you use as a proxy  to gain exposure to farm commodes (wheat, corn, rice, barley , soy , chicken , hogs, beef) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or some non farm commodities like lumber . Also I 100% realize to take advantage of this now I would need a time machine and go back 6-8 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Investor presentation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_Final.pdf?v=1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1Q21_HIMX-Investor-Presentation_Final.pdf?v=1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR; on why it&amp;#39;s a strong buy:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company is consistently growing each quarter, financially speaking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future guidance is extremely positive

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Himax is the dominant automotive TDDI technology provider with mass production experience and advanced specification for leading panel makers. Although only small volume shipments in 2020, we anticipate meaningful shipment volume starting 2H 2021&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industry itself is projected to grow in the coming years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industry itself is important (components for phones, tablets, cars, TVs and more).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) About the company:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review slides #8-9 in the above link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Second, let&amp;#39;s review the simple quarterly earnings, including future guidance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Guidance: Q2 2021&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Q1 2021&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Q4 2020&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Q3 2020&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Q2 2020&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15-20% increase QoQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;$309 M*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;$276 M*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;$240 M*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;187&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.54 - .60&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;.38*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;.20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;.05&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;.01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross Margin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45.5% - 47.5%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;40.2%*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;31.2%*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;22.3%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;21.0%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;All-time high&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Customer list by product types:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FULL CUSTOMER LIST - Slide #17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DDIC - #11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDDI - #13&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WLO &amp;amp; 3D Sensing - #14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CIS &amp;amp; Ultralow Power Smart Sensing - #15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LCoS Microdisplays - #16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Market share for Display Drivers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slide #12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Panel&lt;/strong&gt; - 10.1% (down vs previous quarter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LCD Smartphone&lt;/strong&gt; - 10.4% (down vs previous quarter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tablet&lt;/strong&gt; - 42.9% (up vs previous quarter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automobile&lt;/strong&gt; - 29.7% (up vs previous quarter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*It should be noted, Automobile is currently a very profitable portion of the business (hence the growing financials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Global TDDI Forecast:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slide #20 (in units)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2020&lt;/strong&gt; - 921 M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2021&lt;/strong&gt; - 871 M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2022&lt;/strong&gt; - 959 M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt; - 1,037 M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt; - 1,099 M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt; - 1,168 M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical analysis (TA)&lt;/strong&gt; uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;priced in&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security&amp;#39;s price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m interested in what effect this might have on the value of Ethereum (especially as I have some of those) but also, the effect on other crypto currencies reputation in the general economy as a normal means to purchase goods?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious from an investment perspective but also from an economy perspective. If this becomes the new norm then how will purchases of these kind of assets be tracked / taxed / audited etc. And what would this spell for banking in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see it as a potential paradigm shift in the way things are sold. Especially if the successful bidder actually pays for the Banksy using crypto currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really interested to hear thoughts on this? Do you think its just a stunt (Banksy is known for them) or a genuine effort to open up bids to people who hold a lot of their wealth in crypto? Or the dawn of a new era of crypto currency transactions?&lt;/p&gt;

Which made me think. Are there long term trends that it makes sense investing in for at least the next two to five decades?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, ARK Invest identified 5 big trends. One other big trend seems to be the end of petrodollar dominance. Boomers getting older and millennials taking over. Petrodollar slowly losing dominance. Maybe index investing dominance, but that&amp;#39;s debatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not looking at a short-term 5 to 10 year trends such as, for example, weed stocks which I expect to reach market saturation relatively soon (but what do I know), or real estate bubbles, although perhaps it makes sense looking at the long-term trend of urbanization.&lt;/p&gt;

What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bank of America chart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Strategies to Pick Stocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some hands-on advice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited diversification&lt;/strong&gt;, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible &amp;amp; innovative companies&lt;/strong&gt; can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t ignore what is familiar&lt;/strong&gt;, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your strengths&lt;/strong&gt; and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google is your friend&lt;/strong&gt;, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership and the CEO&lt;/strong&gt; are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;resource management&lt;/strong&gt; such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep dive into the company&lt;/strong&gt;: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&amp;amp;P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;: Does this company contribute to a better future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t overpay&lt;/strong&gt; because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid&lt;/strong&gt; owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double down&lt;/strong&gt; on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hold &amp;amp; wait&lt;/strong&gt;: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Don’t lose money”&lt;/strong&gt; – Warren Buffett &amp;amp; treat every dollar as an investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cash&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn&amp;#39;t even get to experience my slim gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave your portfolio in peace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remain calm during market volatility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.&lt;/p&gt;

(collectibles that we treat as currency, commodities etc). I wanted to explore is if there are certain categories of stocks that are better positioned against Inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector (&lt;a href=&quot;https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings&quot;&gt;https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings&lt;/a&gt;). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I&amp;#39;m looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin (&lt;a href=&quot;https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings&quot;&gt;https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you were worried about inflation eating your gains?&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that each individual small-cap growth stock that is at least remotely known has some cult-like following attached it, convinced it will be the next FAANG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from some the obvious points, such as small-cap growth being prone to manipulation and pump n dump because of their small market cap, the historical data really shows picking winners is next to impossible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a 2018 quantitative research report from Hendrik Bessembinder, the best performing 4% of listed companies drove the entire returns of the stock market since 1926. The remaining 96% of stocks collectively were outperformed by US Treasury Bills. Statistically, you are likely to be better off not investing your money than you would be taking your chances on 96% of the stock market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your odds are even worse when you go hunting for the 1,000+ listed U.S. small-cap growth stocks. You have better chances of finding a needle in a haystack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot understand how this mindset of &amp;quot;finding the next Amazon&amp;quot; has taken such great hold and now everyone thinks their &amp;quot;DD&amp;quot; is completely infallible if they &amp;quot;believe in the stock&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hold it long term.&amp;quot; Confirmation bias, survival bias, and the endowment effect have run rampant, and a lot people who do not know what they are doing are going to (or already have) lost a lot of money they cannot afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting pay for hourly crew members will range from $11 to $18 an hour. There are opportunities to advance to general manager positions with average annual pay of $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol said the current labor market is among the most challenging he&amp;#39;s seen in his career in the restaurant industry. He cited a range of reasons including child care and a rethinking of work post-pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the labor market heats up, Chipotle Mexican Grill announced Monday it&amp;#39;s raising pay for restaurant workers, reaching an average of $15 an hour by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has also introduced employee referral bonuses of $200 for crew members and $750 for apprentices or general managers, as it looks to recruit 20,000 new workers across the country to support its peak season and new restaurant openings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pay hike for new and existing restaurant workers, both hourly and salaried, will roll out over the next few weeks, with hourly crew wages starting in the range of $11 to $18 per hour. There are also opportunities to advance to a restaurateur position, which is the highest-ranking general manager, with average compensation of $100,000 a year, Chipotle said, in as little as 3½ years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chipotle is getting creative in its hiring initiatives. It is hosting a virtual career fair on Thursday on Discord, the social platform, that will include sessions with current employees. Other Chipotle benefits include mental health care and 401(k) plans and debt-free degrees for workers after 120 days from nonprofit, accredited universities in partnership with Guild Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business premise seems sound enough, at least on the surface. The problem: Owning a vehicle is more trouble than it&amp;#39;s worth, but taxi cabs are costly and so yesterday. The solution: Just use a mobile app to summon a contracted driver who will ferry you from one place to another at a more efficient (i.e. cheaper) price. Everyone wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except not everyone is winning with this modern-day business model. Shareholders of ride-hailing powerhouses Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) just saw another quarter of steep losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both companies fared better than expected, mind you, at least on the earnings front. But both companies&amp;#39; losses continue to scale up in step with revenue growth rather than decline, as their two biggest expenses are directly tethered to sales. Those expenses are the cost of revenue -- what Uber and Lyft are paying their drivers -- and marketing expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s past time for investors to ask what the plausible path to profitability looks like for these companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woman on cell phone standing in front of a broken-down car.
IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s changing?
For the record, the analyst community isn&amp;#39;t fazed by the losses so far, apparently convinced that both ride-hailing brands are on the cusp of fiscal breakthroughs. Current estimates imply Uber will cut its operating losses by more than half this year, and do the same again in 2022. Those same analysts are predicting Lyft will swing to operating profitability next year. Investors are (for the most part) buying into this bullishness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphics below put things in perspective, starting with Uber Technologies. Notice how, thus far, the company&amp;#39;s cost of revenue has consumed 45% to 50% of revenue. Analysts believe these costs will fall toward 40% of sales in the foreseeable future, when marketing spending is expected to slide well below 30% of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber&amp;#39;s profitability is projected to widen soon, but the company&amp;#39;s not explained how its driver costs are going to be curbed.
DATA SOURCE: THOMSON REUTERS. CHART BY AUTHOR. DOLLAR FIGURES ARE IN MILLIONS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same basic concern applies to Lyft, though at different proportions. Lyft&amp;#39;s cost of sales -- or its direct cost of delivering services -- lingered in excess of 50% of sales before COVID-19 took hold. Now expectations are that those costs can be whittled down to under 40% of revenue. Marketing expenses are projected to fall to single-digit percentages, while administrative expenses are expected to fall despite expansion into new ventures like bikes, scooters, car rentals, and mass transit (public busing) partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lyft&amp;#39;s driver costs are supposed to inch lower, improving profits. The ride-hailing outfit has yet to explain how this biggest cost is feasibly going to fall though.
DATA SOURCE: THOMSON REUTERS. CHART BY AUTHOR. ALL DOLLAR FIGURES ARE IN MILLIONS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s missing from both of these progressive forecasts, however, is a clear explanation of how the ride-hailing business model is going to cost less on a per-mile or per-ride basis in the future than it has in the past. More scale doesn&amp;#39;t inherently translate into profitability if most of your expenses are variable costs rather than fixed costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unanswered questions and overlooked threats
Being pessimistic about either company&amp;#39;s future is tough these days, of course. Both stocks are rated as buys, and each is currently trading below analysts&amp;#39; consensus price targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the encouraging commentary of each outfit&amp;#39;s top executives. Lyft CEO Logan Green explained during the company&amp;#39;s first-quarter conference call that &amp;quot;as the recovery continues, we&amp;#39;re confident we&amp;#39;ll be able to deliver strong organic growth and adjusted EBITDA improvements.&amp;quot; That swing to positive EBITDA should take shape during Q3 of this year, according to the company. Uber&amp;#39;s chief Dara Khosrowshahi is just as bullish, commenting during his company&amp;#39;s first-quarter call that &amp;quot;Even as we invested for growth, the benefits of scale and rigorous cost management drove an adjusted EBITDA improvement of $253 million year on year and $95 million quarter on quarter.&amp;quot; Khosrowshahi also broadly suggested positive EBITDA figures were in sight. Package and food deliveries will help on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither chief, however, explained exactly how or why it&amp;#39;s going to cost less to drive a passenger from point A to point B in 2021 than it did in 2019 -- before the pandemic shook things up, and when gasoline was still dirt-cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also naive to ignore how efforts to protect so-called &amp;quot;gig&amp;quot; workers aren&amp;#39;t already threatening both companies&amp;#39; business models, which lean heavily on the relatively lower costs of contracted drivers (as opposed to conventional employees). The threat of that additional expense will only grow as time marches on, and even without the regulatory movement we&amp;#39;ve already seen, would-be drivers aren&amp;#39;t being lured back en masse despite big sign-up bonuses and incentives put in place last month. Uber&amp;#39;s management clearly conceded this headwind during last week&amp;#39;s call, although it downplayed the actual scope of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To its credit, Lyft cut its marketing spending dramatically last quarter. Uber&amp;#39;s Khosrowshah believes his company will need less advertising in the future as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That too may mostly be wishful thinking, though, given the competition coming to the market. Alphabet&amp;#39;s driverless ride-hailing service Waymo is up and running in Phoenix, and the company&amp;#39;s ultimate aim is to expand the service. In the meantime, smaller start-ups like Blacklane, Myle, and Nomad are just some of the names standing ready to swipe share from a market Uber and Lyft largely developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that marketing isn&amp;#39;t something that&amp;#39;s easy to simply stop doing, or even curtail. It&amp;#39;s conceivable both of these companies will need to expand rather than reduce their marketing outlays in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line
Both Uber and Lyft can continue to scale up, but to what end? Both have already been scaling up for some time. Expenses have merely scaled up in near-perfect step with revenue, as have net losses. Investors may want to start asking for specifics about each company&amp;#39;s cost-reduction plans, and then decide whether or not they&amp;#39;re plausible.

In 2019, 51.5  million adults were living with a mental illness in the U.S., and the  number of people suffering and drug costs, already in the tens of  billions of dollars annually, are projected to grow in the years ahead,  with Covid-19 compounding mental health issues globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drugs long stigmatized, such as psilocybin and MDMA, are rising in  profile as mental illness treatment options. Just last week, results  from a phase 3 trial of MDMA combined with talk therapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder showed results that were impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This  is a pivotal event,” said Elemer Piros, a biotech analyst at Roth  Capital Partners who covers the emerging alternative mental health  treatment space. “It may not seem humongous, but it is one of the best  and most rigorously executed trials in the space. And the results  corroborate what we have seen time and time again from smaller studies  over the past two decades,” he said, referencing remission rates double  that of a placebo. “The magical experiences kept showing up, but no one  had the courage to take it through to regulators.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want some input here, cause I simply can&amp;#39;t make my mind up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently holding my PF, while adding a small amount of money in 5 different index funds monthly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of money I&amp;#39;m saving about $ 700 in an world index fund every month as locked in pension savings, and another $ 700 in 5 different index funds for personal savings (E.M., Scandinavia, Europe, World and small cap - I&amp;#39;m considering wiping the Europe fund here, but I digress). So that&amp;#39;s $ 1400 montly in indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also stacking about $ 2000 in cash every month. This goes hopefully into the market in the future or as downpayment on my mortgage (depending on inflation and change in interest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that I have a stock picking PF with a handful of companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s the kicker. I&amp;#39;m aware I can&amp;#39;t time the market. I don&amp;#39;t believe I can, but the question is whether I see a big upside in indexes from here on. And I&amp;#39;m not sure I do. The markets might keep growing a bit more, but I feel the risk reward is unfavourable atm, and I wonder if indexes isn&amp;#39;t the right thing now. I honestly feel far more comfortable with doing value buys, and there&amp;#39;s less risk of buying dividend blue chips who aren&amp;#39;t in favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago my last big buy happened and that was Bayer AG. After that I&amp;#39;ve kind of been on the sidelines as I haven&amp;#39;t seen anything interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s your opinion on investing right now? Would you stick to investing heavily in indexes or rotate into stock picking?  If so, would you sell off index funds? Or ride it out?&lt;/p&gt;
