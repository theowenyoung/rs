The momentum seems to continue across the market, stocks getting super pumped. There are even travel stocks that are HIGHER than their highest of highs before the pandemic. It&#39;s truly a confounding market that I cannot explain or begin to understand, So I&#39;m looking for some fundamental guidance</p>\n\n<p>The portfolio is 80% long term with safer more long term markets, and 20% short term more risky picks. Part of the 80% are recovery stocks that are most likely to bounce back after a correction.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lll90n/entering_long_positions_during_52_week_high/","title":"Entering long positions during 52 week high markets.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T20:46:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 20:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lll90n","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lll90n/entering_long_positions_during_52_week_high/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lll90n/entering_long_positions_during_52_week_high/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"learningunreal","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/learningunreal","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"learningunreal","score":64,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"在52周高位市场进入多头仓位。","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，朋友们，当计划6个月的策略，重新进入市场Im\n试图弄清楚事情的真相。现在我们看到52周的高点，在许多的\n资产。我很好奇，在这些期间，人们对开仓的看法是什么？\n高点与等待轻微修正。\n\n如果一个投资者...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在52周高位市場進入多頭倉位。","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，朋友們，當計劃6個月的策略，重新進入市場Im\n試圖弄清楚事情的真相。現在我們看到52周的高點，在許多的\n資產。我很好奇，在這些期間，人們對開倉的看法是什麼？\n高點與等待輕微修正。\n\n如果一個投資者...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lww0h7","excerpt":"This meme stock explosion has made me even more tight and Scrooge-like with my\nmoney.
