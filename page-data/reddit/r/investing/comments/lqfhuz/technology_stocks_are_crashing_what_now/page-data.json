Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it&#39;s frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.</li>\n<li>S&amp;P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.</li>\n<li>DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it&#39;s going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&amp;P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.</p>\n\n<p>If you buy stocks, you&#39;ve got to have conviction in them. You&#39;ve got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they&#39;re &quot;overvalued&quot;. Of course not. I&#39;m going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It&#39;s the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.</p>\n\n<p>Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.</p>\n\n<p>If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You&#39;ve got to have conviction in what you&#39;re buying. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmelade brand. If there&#39;s a 30% discount I&#39;ll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don&#39;t have conviction in your holdings in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>So here&#39;s what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it&#39;s there in the first place. Start with &quot;I own XYZ because...&quot;. Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can&#39;t tell that story, sell it off. It doesn&#39;t belong in your portfolio. Free up that cash so you can pile in when spectacular opportunities arise in future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/","title":"Technology stocks are crashing – what now","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T11:28:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 11:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lqfhuz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"trendarchitect","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/trendarchitect","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"trendarchitect","score":3977,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"科技股暴跌--现在怎么办","the_new_excerpt":"刚才有个朋友给我发信息，说他的投资组合损失了10%的价值。\n最近，而且这完全是末日来临。从期货的情况来看，国家质检总局是\n从高点下跌了6.8%（仅今早就下跌了1.8%的缺口）。我明白，这是\n令人沮丧。\n\n值得注意的是，抛售伤...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"科技股暴跌--現在怎麼辦","the_new_excerpt":"剛纔有個朋友給我發信息，說他的投資組合損失了10%的價值。\n最近，而且這完全是末日來臨。從期貨的情況來看，國家質檢總局是\n從高點下跌了6.8%（僅今早就下跌了1.8%的缺口）。我明白，這是\n令人沮喪。\n\n值得注意的是，拋售傷...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m0q5bm","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0q5bm/gme_yolo_update_mar_8_2021/","title":"GME YOLO update — Mar 8 2021","date":"March 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME YOLO更新--2021年3月8日。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME YOLO更新--2021年3月8日。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m0l36g","excerpt":"Competitive advantage stripped from Moderna and Novavax when Johnson and Johnson\ngot the results from their single shot vaccine.
