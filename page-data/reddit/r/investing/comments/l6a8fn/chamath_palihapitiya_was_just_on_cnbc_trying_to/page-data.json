who apparently took a $100k call position in GME &quot;to learn&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><a

point that Hedge funds have had the advantage until now, but with social media being where it is, a bunch of retail investors with a cellphone can take the other side of a trade and be effective at it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I felt that Scott Wapner was pushing for him to admit  that GME is horribly mispriced, which it really is on  massive scale, but Chamath did not give him that, instead pushing the narrative that the hedge funds being 200% short the float is what is really wrong and the time has come where retail traders are leveling the playing field.</p>\n\n<p>This is indeed a watershed moment in the markets, things are not going back to where they used to be.</p>\n\n<p>I am really concerned that the SEC is going to take some unfair action like they did back in 2001 when they decided you need $25k minimum to daytrade.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l6a8fn/chamath_palihapitiya_was_just_on_cnbc_trying_to/","title":"Chamath Palihapitiya
