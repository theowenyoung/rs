Never before have I seen so many people lose so much out of sheer ignorance. </p>\n\n<p><strong>First and foremost I want to establish a fact: Short squeezes are not permanent.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I made a post a week ago telling everyone that short squeezes were not permanent.  GME opened at over $300 that day.  By Friday it would close at $63.  The mechanics of a short squeeze make this an inevitability.  They are, by definition, a short term event fueled by a sudden spike in demand, an unsustainable spike in demand driven by short covering.  That demand is necessarily going to end.  So, when you see a stock skyrocket from the 20s to over 300 in the matter of a week taking a long position is a less constructive use of your money than just burning cash for heat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What this isn&#39;t: an &quot;I told you so&quot;.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t really care about that.  The red on the ledger is enough for people to eventually learn they were wrong.  Sure, they&#39;ll grovel about conspiracies for a bit, Janet Yellen called Vlad and told him to fuck the retail investors.  Hedge funds had a &quot;short ladder attack&quot; (for why that&#39;s not a think, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/\">see here</a> or <a href=\"https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qdq0y5b79rzb/Wallstreetbets-Conspiracy-Theorists-Claim-a-Short-Ladder-Attack-Brought-Down-GameStop-Short-Sellers-Have-No-Idea-What-They-re-Talking-About\">here</a>.  They&#39;ll claim that the DTC intentionally stopped out retail order flow, despite retail orders being <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop\">net sells</a> for most of this endeavor.  Whatever, so you&#39;re going to see a lot of blame on anything but the fact that it&#39;s obviously not smart to go long at the top of a goddamn short squeeze.  This is the financial equivalent of doing 150MPH on a dirt road then blaming the tires, the loose gravel, the 2mph headwind, or interstellar radio waves altering your tire pressure when you crash.  No, you shouldn&#39;t have been doing 150MPH on a dirt road. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>What this is: reflecting on the mob</strong></p>\n\n<p>The shameful part of this is that in your foaming at the mouth rabid need to believe in this story you downvoted and ridiculed anyone who brought up risks, you attacked news agencies who called it irresponsible, you barraged threads and subreddits with hype posts.  For the first time in this sub&#39;s entire history we actually had to restrict posting to manual approval only.  </p>\n\n<p>I spoke with a reporter for a major publication working on this story, and he relayed that he recently interviewed a homeless man who bought three shares at $315 hoping to get himself out of poverty.  do you know how much $945 can do for a homeless person??  There&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/glob1kf/?context=3\">this post</a>, where a disabled man on government support hopes to build a house with GME gains, again buying in near the top.  These are two examples, but there are hundreds if not thousands more.</p>\n\n<p>20 year old middle class kids blowing their beer money for the month on GME doesn&#39;t bother me.  who cares.  But these are people who cannot afford to lose even a few hundred dollars.  These are setbacks that could have equated to months worth of food, new wardrobes, necessary medical attention, etc. </p>\n\n<p>We can never prevent those in poor financial situations from making poor decisions, but we can and absolutely should hold ourselves to the standard that we will at least not foster an environment that encourages poor decisions.  Many of you will lay blame elsewhere, but if you downvoted a post discussing risks of GME, accused someone of being a shill, encouraged someone to buy without first understanding their situation, etc. then you are culpable here.  </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>You can, but should you?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Much has been said about Reddit&#39;s ability to affect the outside world, and now just like with the Boston bombing everyone dove in head first without bothering to examine the risks, the drawbacks, the losses, and the ramifications for those who can&#39;t afford them.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>So, what did Reddit accomplish here?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, nothing aside from transferring a lot of retail wealth to institutional funds, again.  Sure, we can jerk off all day to Melvin&#39;s down month.  Perhaps they were hedged and they&#39;ll have a monster January, perhaps they were not.  But all of the other funds that took the long end of this early on, with managers that understood the kindergarten aspects of short squeezes - they bailed out in the 200-300 range selling some to short and some to unwitting retail investors engaged in a fervent and ultimately useless battle against some imaginary foe.  </p>\n\n<p>This wasn&#39;t social justice, it wasn&#39;t some populist uprising, and I don&#39;t care how much AOC, Ted Cruz, Mark Cuban, or the Pope wants to dogpile in on this.  There was nothing that happened here aside from a bunch of retail traders who didn&#39;t know what they were doing encouraging a whole lot of other retail investors who couldn&#39;t afford it to give away money they didn&#39;t have to institutions.  </p>\n\n<p>Next time y&#39;all want to effect change just have a charity drive for UNICEF, or send money to a PAC focused on fighting inequality.  Write your senator, picket congress (peacefully, no mob bullshit), organize a sit in, whatever.  But let&#39;s not encourage broke people to give their hard earned thousands to hedge funds.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>And most importantly, the next time this happens, because it will happen again, for the love of Christ try to understand what the fuck is going on before jumping on the hype train.  And stop downvoting and ridiculing people that do understand what is happening with an opinion you don&#39;t like.</strong></p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for listening to my Ted<sup>X</sup> Talk<sup>I</sup> <sup>look</sup> <sup>forward</sup> <sup>to</sup> <sup>hearing</sup> <sup>about</sup> <sup>how</sup> <sup>much</sup> <sup>this</sup> <sup>hurt</sup> <sup>everyone&#39;s</sup> <sup>feelings</sup> <sup>in</sup> <sup>the</sup> <sup>comments.</sup></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ldzb68/gme_mob_mentality_and_the_irresponsibility_of/","title":"GME, Mob Mentality, and the irresponsibility of Reddit hype.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-06T19:58:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-06 19:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ldzb68","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldzb68/gme_mob_mentality_and_the_irresponsibility_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldzb68/gme_mob_mentality_and_the_irresponsibility_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"MasterCookSwag","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MasterCookSwag","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"MasterCookSwag","score":516,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME、Mob Mentality以及Reddit炒作的不负责任。","the_new_excerpt":"这并不是什么新鲜事，但极端化的趋势已经明显。以前我从未\n看到这么多人因为无知而损失惨重。\n\n首先我要确定一个事实：短线压仓不是永久的。\n\n我在一周前发了一篇文章，告诉大家空头压制不是\n永久....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME、Mob Mentality以及Reddit炒作的不負責任。","the_new_excerpt":"這並不是什麼新鮮事，但極端化的趨勢已經明顯。以前我從未\n看到這麼多人因爲無知而損失慘重。\n\n首先我要確定一個事實：短線壓倉不是永久的。\n\n我在一週前發了一篇文章，告訴大家空頭壓制不是\n永久....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lnwgbt","excerpt":"Hello.
