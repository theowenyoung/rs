I did my taxes a week ago, thinking it&#39;d be good to it done with since I had some time. I paid a lot in taxes this year since I invested some money when the market was down, figuring the shutdown would end at some point. Seeing how the market rose back so quickly, I sold, thinking we were in a bubble. We may still be, but that isn&#39;t the main point of me writing this.</p>\n\n<p>The point of it is that the stimulus bill might have an income cap of $75k. Normally, my salary is below the cap that might pass. However, by selling my investments, I made enough money to the point where I passed the $75k mark.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, this income cap might not be in the final law, but if it is you should be sure to either A) wait to file if your 2020 income is higher than your past income or B) file quickly if your 2020 income is less than your 2019 income.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I know I&#39;m fortunate that I made more money this year, but this is an investing subreddit. Helping people get more money is part of the point of investing. I&#39;m sure an extra $1400 would help a lot of people. I don&#39;t have a six figure salary, I just try to be smart with my money and posted this in part to help other people do the same.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lh1xy6/dont_file_your_taxes_early_under_some/","title":"Don't File Your Taxes Early Under Some Circumstances","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T04:29:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 04:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lh1xy6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lh1xy6/dont_file_your_taxes_early_under_some/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lh1xy6/dont_file_your_taxes_early_under_some/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Michigan1837","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Michigan1837","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Michigan1837","score":74,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"某些情况下不要提前报税","the_new_excerpt":"这部分是我的发泄，但如果我的经验能帮助到这里的其他人的话\n避免同样的错误，我很高兴与大家分享。我一周前做了我的税。\n我想既然我有时间，就把它做了吧。我付出了很多\n今年的税收，因为我投资了一些钱，当市场下跌，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"某些情況下不要提前報稅","the_new_excerpt":"這部分是我的發泄，但如果我的經驗能幫助到這裏的其他人的話\n避免同樣的錯誤，我很高興與大家分享。我一週前做了我的稅。\n我想既然我有時間，就把它做了吧。我付出了很多\n今年的稅收，因爲我投資了一些錢，當市場下跌，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lrz748","excerpt":"Hey, i'm new to the investing life and I just keep wondering why afterhours\ntrading even is a thing?
