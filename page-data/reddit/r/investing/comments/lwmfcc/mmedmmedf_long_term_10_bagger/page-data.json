Not sure how many people are familiar with the psychedelic space, but I’m here to tell you guys a bit about mindmed and the space as a whole. </p>\n\n<p>The basic investment thesis is this: current available mental health treatments such as adderall, Xanax, suboxone, etc simply dull out, or put a temporary bandaid on the issue. After looking at the efficacy rates for issues such as smoking cessation, PTSD, treatment resistant depression, etc, it is clear that psychedelics could turn into a massive industry that disrupts the way we treat mental health. This could lead mind medicine and other similar companies to multi billion dollar buyouts from big pharma companies. </p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of fantastic companies in the space, but mindmed is by far my favourite. For full disclosure I’m currently long ~100k warrants, already up bigly. </p>\n\n<p>Mindmed has a diverse pipeline for a multitude of issues, plenty of cash for future R&amp;D, and plenty of fantastic partnerships in academia/pharma. Additionally, this stock cannot be traded yet by anyone on robinhood due to it being on the OTC market. A nasdaq uplist (expected) would open the floodgates to a ton of new retail buyers. There is also EXTREMELY low institutional ownership, basically 0%. </p>\n\n<p>At a market cap of 1.5 billion Canadian dollars, this can easily be a 10 bagger once there is more media attention surrounding it, and more progress is made regarding clinical trials. People are not talking about the psychedelic space yet. </p>\n\n<p>Last thing before I start seeing this in the comments, this does NOT at all compare to the weed industry. There are far more barriers to entry, addresses a totally different market (recreational vs medicinal), and has the added advantage of interest from big pharma.</p>\n\n<p>I’m aware this isn’t very detailed or anything, I don’t have the patience to put together a full DD post. I’m simply encouraging everyone in this group to do consider what this company has going for it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lwmfcc/mmedmmedf_long_term_10_bagger/","title":"MMED/MMEDF - long term 10+ bagger","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-03T08:29:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-03 08:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lwmfcc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lwmfcc/mmedmmedf_long_term_10_bagger/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lwmfcc/mmedmmedf_long_term_10_bagger/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"JR_Rahn_ismyfather","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JR_Rahn_ismyfather","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"JR_Rahn_ismyfather","score":130,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"MMED/MMEDF----长期10年以上装袋机。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。不知道有多少人熟知迷幻的?\n空间，但我在这里要告诉你们一些关于mindmed和空间作为一个。\n整体。\n\n基本的投资论点是：目前现有的心理健康治疗手段\n如阿德拉、Xanax、suboxone等简单枯燥，或... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"MMED/MMEDF----長期10年以上裝袋機。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。不知道有多少人熟知迷幻的?\n空間，但我在這裏要告訴你們一些關於mindmed和空間作爲一個。\n整體。\n\n基本的投資論點是：目前現有的心理健康治療手段\n如阿德拉、Xanax、suboxone等簡單枯燥，或... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m7a1aw","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7a1aw/if_im_still_in_im_still_in/","title":"IF I’M STILL IN, I’M STILL IN! 💎🙌🚀🚀🚀🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🍆📡🪐⭐️💫🌌","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果我还在，我就还在! 💎🙌🚀🚀🚀🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🍆📡🪐⭐️💫🌌","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果我還在，我就還在! 💎🙌🚀🚀🚀🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🍆📡🪐⭐️💫🌌","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1372558216115150852","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1372558216115150852","title":"30-Year Mortgage Rate in the US moves up to 3.09%, highest since last June and 44 bps above its all-time low of 2.65% in early January. https://t.co/0Pss5gO06z","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 18, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国30年期抵押贷款利率升至3.09%，为去年6月以来最高，比1月初的历史低点2.65%高出44个基点。https://t.co/0Pss5gO06z。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國30年期抵押貸款利率升至3.09%，爲去年6月以來最高，比1月初的歷史低點2.65%高出44個基點。https://t.co/0Pss5gO06z。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lwmfcc","previousId":"RedditPost-m7a1aw","nextId":"TweetPost-1372558216115150852","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lwmfcc/mmedmmedf_long_term_10_bagger/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
