The contract was for a base year and three option years, and Palantir was awarded $110 million at the time for the base year.</p>\n\n<p>In the last year, Army Vantage has helped leaders make data-driven decisions in the fight against Covid-19.</p>\n\n<p>The second contract is a two-year deal worth up to $31.5 million with the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) to provide a software platform for secure, reliable and timely processing of data to enable NHS decision-makers to best plan the use of resources and improve patient care.</p>\n\n<p>NHS personnel will use Palantir&#39;s software to understand how Covid-19 is spreading, identify risks to particularly vulnerable populations, proactively increase health and care resources in emerging hot spots, ensure critical equipment is supplied to the facilities with the greatest need and divert patients and service users to the facilities that are best able to care for them.</p>\n\n<p>The NHS will also use Palantir as part of its planning and operational roll-out of the U.K.’s vaccine program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kk4sd0/denvers_palantir_closes_out_2020_with_nearly_150m/","title":"Denver's Palantir closes out 2020 with nearly $150M in new government contracts","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 25, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-25T20:30:44.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-25 20:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kk4sd0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kk4sd0/denvers_palantir_closes_out_2020_with_nearly_150m/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kk4sd0/denvers_palantir_closes_out_2020_with_nearly_150m/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"NineteenSixtySix","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NineteenSixtySix","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"NineteenSixtySix","score":345,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"丹佛Palantir以近1.5亿美元的新政府合同结束2020年","the_new_excerpt":"丹佛商业杂志\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2020/12/24/palantir-closes-december-2020-contracts.html]\n\n>随着这一年的结束，丹佛最新的科技巨头正在积累新的\n>政府合同。\n>\n>Palantir Technologies，一家价值200亿美元的数据分析软件公司，…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"丹佛Palantir以近1.5億美元的新政府合同結束2020年","the_new_excerpt":"丹佛商業雜誌\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2020/12/24/palantir-closes-december-2020-contracts.html]\n\n>隨着這一年的結束，丹佛最新的科技巨頭正在積累新的\n>政府合同。\n>\n>Palantir Technologies，一家價值200億美元的數據分析軟件公司，…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l0tuot","excerpt":"Revenue: $6.64 billion versus $6.63 billion expected\n\nEarnings per share: $1.19 versus $1.36 expected\n\nGlobal paid subscriber additions: 8.51 million versus 6.03 million expected\n\nNetflix said Tuesday it plans to be cash-flow neutral this year and cash-flow\npositive every year after 2021, and will…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l0tuot/netflix_earnings_report_beat_possible_buyback/","title":"Netflix earnings report beat, possible buyback","date":"January 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Netflix财报超预期，可能回购","the_new_excerpt":"收入：66.4亿美元，预期66.3亿美元。\n\n每股收益。1.19美元，预期为1.36美元\n\n全球付费用户新增。851万，而预期为603万\n\nNetflix周二表示，计划在今年实现现金流中性，现金流。\n2021年以后每年都是正数，并将...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Netflix財報超預期，可能回購","the_new_excerpt":"收入：66.4億美元，預期66.3億美元。\n\n每股收益。1.19美元，預期爲1.36美元\n\n全球付費用戶新增。851萬，而預期爲603萬\n\nNetflix週二表示，計劃在今年實現現金流中性，現金流。\n2021年以後每年都是正數，並將...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l0xphu","excerpt":"My fellow GME-stans,\n\nFor far too long the world has dismissed us as degenerates, gamblers, and\nuninformed retail scum, and while we are some or perhaps all of those things, we\nare also now a powerful force to be taken seriously.
