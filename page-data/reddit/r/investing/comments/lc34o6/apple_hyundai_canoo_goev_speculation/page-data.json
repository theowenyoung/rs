They indicated that this co-developed platform would be used in future vehicles. The E-GMP platform they eventually released seems way less advanced than Canoo&#39;s platform in the photos (e.g. it has struts vs Canoo&#39;s with leaf spring suspension), so the E-GMP platform could be the intermediate step until the co-developed platform is ready.</p>\n\n<p>Apple tried to buy Canoo for it’s skateboard platform in 2020 and was turned down by Canoo. This makes a lot of sense for Apple because Canoo platform is really advanced (steer-by-wire, leaf spring suspension, crash test incorporated into skateboard, batteries incorporated into structure, very modular and fast development times/costs) and lets Apple focus on what they excel at, which is tech and quick development cycles.</p>\n\n<p>Apple eventually forms a manufacturing partnership with Hyundai and it&#39;s rumored they&#39;re using Hyundai skateboard in the &quot;initial&quot; version, which is important because it signals they still want to use 3P skateboard. It seems that while they are likely using the E-GMP platform for the first iteration, the 2024 timeline easily puts them in line to use the new Canoo/Hyundai platform when it is done, which is consistent with the fact that Apple has already tried to purchase Canoo specifically for it&#39;s skateboard platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr -</strong> seems very possible that the Apple car will use the Canoo skateboard as the foundation</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lc34o6/apple_hyundai_canoo_goev_speculation/","title":"Apple - Hyundai - Canoo (GOEV) speculation","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T03:24:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 03:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lc34o6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lc34o6/apple_hyundai_canoo_goev_speculation/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lc34o6/apple_hyundai_canoo_goev_speculation/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"OE4000","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/OE4000","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"OE4000","score":257,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"苹果-现代-卡努（GOEV）猜想","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，这并不是要做一个打气贴，而是一个事件的时间轴和一些。\n猜测，GOEV的滑板平台很有可能会\n实际上最终成为苹果汽车的基础。我觉得Canoo是一个很棒的\n公司的权利，但只是提出一些潜在的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"蘋果-現代-卡努（GOEV）猜想","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，這並不是要做一個打氣貼，而是一個事件的時間軸和一些。\n猜測，GOEV的滑板平臺很有可能會\n實際上最終成爲蘋果汽車的基礎。我覺得Canoo是一個很棒的\n公司的權利，但只是提出一些潛在的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lkmf2w","excerpt":"This is coming from someone who's invested deep in ARKK and ARKG, but is anyone\nelse concerned if their growth is sustainable?
