Revenue of $7.16 billion also topped the Street.</p>\n\n<p>The subscriber shortfall, which caused the stock to drop more than 10% in after-hours trading, was blamed on issues related to the coronavirus. Simply put, the pandemic gaveth, but also taketh away. “We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. “We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup.”</p>\n\n<p>Net cash from operations surged to $777 million in the quarter from $260 million and free cash flow of $692 million was up from $162 million. Netflix confirmed a key metric — that it’s on track to free cash flow break even this year and doesn’t need outside financing anymore to fund day-to-day business. That was a milestone affirmed in the company’s January report, and only reaffirmed the bull thesis as the entire entertainment business continues its shift to streaming.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Continues here - <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/04/netflix-misses-q1-subscriber-targets-first-quarter-2021-covid-19-streaming-1234739802/\">https://deadline.com/2021/04/netflix-misses-q1-subscriber-targets-first-quarter-2021-covid-19-streaming-1234739802/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mve8vh/netflix_misses_q1_subscriber_targets_blaming/","title":"Netflix Misses Q1 Subscriber Targets, Blaming Covid-19 Issues, But Beats Financial Forecasts","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"April 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-21T13:42:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-21 13:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mve8vh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mve8vh/netflix_misses_q1_subscriber_targets_blaming/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mve8vh/netflix_misses_q1_subscriber_targets_blaming/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"WoiLou","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/WoiLou","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"WoiLou","score":1405,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Netflix、Covid-19問題の影響で第1四半期の加入者数目標を下回るも、財務予測は上回る","the_new_excerpt":"Netflixは、第1四半期末時点の全世界の加入者数が2億800万人であると発表しました。\nNetflixは、第1四半期末時点の世界の加入者数を2億800万人と発表しました。\n\nしかし、1株当たり利益は3.75ドルとなり、ウォール街のアナリストの予想を大きく上回りました。\n1株当たり利益は3.75ドルとなり、ウォール街のアナリストの予想を大きく上回りました。売上高は\n$7.16...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Netflix未能达到第一季度的用户目标，归咎于Covid-19问题，但超过了财务预测。","the_new_excerpt":"Netflix报告说，截至第一季度末，全球有2.08亿用户。\n季度，没有达到其自己预测的2.1亿。\n\n这个流媒体巨头确实超越了财务目标，但其每股收益\n3.75美元，远远超过华尔街分析师的预期。收入为\n$7.16...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Netflix未能達到第一季度的用戶目標，歸咎於Covid-19問題，但超過了財務預測。","the_new_excerpt":"Netflix報告說，截至第一季度末，全球有2.08億用戶。\n季度，沒有達到其自己預測的2.1億。\n\n這個流媒體巨頭確實超越了財務目標，但其每股收益\n3.75美元，遠遠超過華爾街分析師的預期。收入爲\n$7.16...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mv79ir","excerpt":"Are all able to be used for both buying and selling?\n\nFrom what I know, limit pricing for buying means you set a price and if the\nmarket price falls to ur limit price or below, it will help you to buy the\nstock.
