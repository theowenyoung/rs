This is the part where I’m confused. I understand that trailing stop loss follows price increases and stops when price decreases. So what would my stop loss be if I have 20,30,40% profit?</p>\n\n<p>Right now one of my trade has a 20% profit. I set the stop loss at break even + 5%. Giving the trade a 15% wiggle room, is this too much room? The stock exchange I use has a 7% limit fluctuations for every stock meaning it cannot go below 7% any given day.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your input!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ld5vgo/protecting_your_profit_please_share_your_method/","title":"Protecting your profit.
