S&amp;P 500 had about 200% returns. There is a lot of overlap, basically tech outperformed.</p>\n\n<p>My main brokerage account is heavily weighted towards tech, my retirement and 401k accounts are boring VTSAX or S&amp;P500 - 10% returns will get me to my retirement goals. Obviously in hindsight I wish I had higher tech weight in my retirement accounts since I do tend to believe more in those companies.</p>\n\n<p>The business model of heavy tech companies are in many ways superior. You can generate massive margins with a smaller labor and capital investment given that software is built to scale.</p>\n\n<p>However, now you have to pay a big premium for tech. Really for any company to succeed in the 21st century they need to be able to harness and utilize modern technology, so even if a company isn&#39;t &#39;tech&#39; they need to be good at technology. It feels like many up and coming tech companies are being priced as next FANG potential when this probably not the case.</p>\n\n<p>Do you expect another decade of tech outperformance?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/le5uco/nasdaq_vs_sp_500_next_decade/","title":"Nasdaq vs S&P 500 Next Decade","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-07T02:53:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-07 02:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"le5uco","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/le5uco/nasdaq_vs_sp_500_next_decade/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/le5uco/nasdaq_vs_sp_500_next_decade/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"m4329b","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/m4329b","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"m4329b","score":75,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"纳斯达克与标普500指数未来十年的比较","the_new_excerpt":"过去10年纳斯达克表现巨大，大概有400%的回报。标准普尔500指数有\n200%左右的收益。重合度很高，基本是科技股跑赢了。\n\n我的主力经纪账户偏重于科技，我的退休和\n401k账户很无聊VTSAX或S&P500--10%的回报率会让...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"納斯達克與標普500指數未來十年的比較","the_new_excerpt":"過去10年納斯達克表現巨大，大概有400%的回報。標準普爾500指數有\n200%左右的收益。重合度很高，基本是科技股跑贏了。\n\n我的主力經紀賬戶偏重於科技，我的退休和\n401k賬戶很無聊VTSAX或S&P500--10%的回報率會讓...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1363140248620961795","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1363140248620961795","title":"Bitcoin Annual Returns... https://t.co/iRHl7H6MM6","date":"February 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"比特币年度收益... https://t.co/iRHl7H6MM6","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"比特幣年度收益... https://t.co/iRHl7H6MM6","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lnrr7a","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnrr7a/gabe_slips_that_squeeze_has_not_squozeth/","title":"Gabe Slips that Squeeze has NOT Squozeth 🚀🚀","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 20, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Gabe Slips that Squeeze has NOT Squozeth 🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Gabe Slips that Squeeze has NOT Squozeth 🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-le5uco","previousId":"TweetPost-1363140248620961795","nextId":"RedditPost-lnrr7a","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/le5uco/nasdaq_vs_sp_500_next_decade/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
