That included examples with how firms handled proxy voting on behalf of investors, as well as &quot;unsubstantiated and potentially misleading claims&quot; regarding socially responsible investment strategies.</p>\n\n<p>The alert is the latest in a series of actions the agency has taken to incorporate climate risks and social and governance issues into its framework since the inauguration President Joe Biden.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, the SEC deployed a team to police climate risk disclosure issues. It has also launched an effort to update guidance for public companies on how they share information with investors on climate risk and made the topic a priority for 2021 examinations.</p>\n\n<p>Socially responsible funds have grown more popular with investors in recent years. A record $51 billion flooded into sustainable U.S. funds in 2020 alone, according to Morningstar. But critics have said that some may overstate their credentials to attract cash.</p>\n\n<p>The SEC&#39;s exam staff, which is continuing its review, found instances where firms did not have formal processes in place for ESG investing, though they claimed to. In some cases, the SEC said advisors did not have ways to &quot;reasonably track&quot; or screen for investments in certain industries.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of proxy voting, the SEC said it found instances where some investors were told they could vote separately on ESG-related proposals, but then were never given that chance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mobt6t/us_sec_review_of_socially_responsible_funds_finds/","title":"U.S. SEC review of socially responsible funds finds 'potentially misleading' claims","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"April 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-11T08:26:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-11 08:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mobt6t","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mobt6t/us_sec_review_of_socially_responsible_funds_finds/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mobt6t/us_sec_review_of_socially_responsible_funds_finds/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"pololololo12222","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pololololo12222","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"pololololo12222","score":83,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"米国SECによる社会的責任ファンドのレビューで「誤解を招く恐れのある」主張を発見","the_new_excerpt":"ワシントン（ロイター） - 米国証券取引委員会は、金曜日に\n米国証券取引委員会は、環境・社会・ガバナンス（ESG）問題への投資について、「誤解を招く可能性のある」主張と不十分な管理を発見したと発表した。\n米国証券取引委員会は金曜日、投資アドバイザーとファンドを対象とした調査で、環境・社会・ガバナンス（ESG）問題への投資について「誤解を招く可能性のある」主張と不十分な管理を発見したと発表した。\n誤解を招く恐れがある」と指摘しました。\n\n規制当局はファンドに警告し、その...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美国SEC审查社会责任基金发现 \"潜在误导性 \"说法","the_new_excerpt":"华盛顿（路透社）--美国证券交易委员会星期五\n说，它已发现 \"潜在的误导性 \"索赔和控制不足的问题。\n投资环境、社会和治理(ESG)问题的审查。\n投资顾问和基金。\n\n监管机构警告基金，其...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國SEC審查社會責任基金髮現 \"潛在誤導性 \"說法","the_new_excerpt":"華盛頓（路透社）--美國證券交易委員會星期五\n說，它已發現 \"潛在的誤導性 \"索賠和控制不足的問題。\n投資環境、社會和治理(ESG)問題的審查。\n投資顧問和基金。\n\n監管機構警告基金，其...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n9jqdc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9jqdc/me_holding_pltr_rn/","title":"Me holding PLTR rn","date":"May 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"私はPLTRを保持しています rn","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我持有PLTR rn","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我持有PLTR rn","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-n9flbc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9flbc/when_youre_desperately_trying_to_sell_your/","title":"When you’re desperately trying to sell your sinking SPY position, but RH won’t let you due to “insufficient overnight funds.”","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"May 11, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"沈みかけているSPYのポジションを必死に売ろうとしているのに、RHが「夜間資金不足」を理由に売らせてくれないとき。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"当你拼命想卖出你正在下沉的SPY头寸时，但RH却因 \"隔夜资金不足 \"而不让你卖。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當你拼命想賣出你正在下沉的SPY頭寸時，但RH卻因 \"隔夜資金不足 \"而不讓你賣。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mobt6t","previousId":"RedditPost-n9jqdc","nextId":"RedditPost-n9flbc","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mobt6t/us_sec_review_of_socially_responsible_funds_finds/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
