And they are absolutely obliterating them.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why they bailed out Melvin, because it’s their problem anyways. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, I believe we have uncovered is that the Citadel fund and Citadel Securities - both of which are owned by the same Griffin guy - only have (had) about $35-$40B of assets to their name collectively.</p>\n\n<p>They’ve already had to bailout Melvin to the tune of $2B. And that was at GME $150.  </p>\n\n<p>That’s pretty wild considering CS’ total “record” revenue in 2020 was 6B.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve also learned that short interest in GME is INCREASING, and this may not let up.</p>\n\n<p>So what if GME actually goes above $500? That might sound crazy, but that’s a move from like  $15B market cap to $35B market cap? We all know that’s actually possible in this market.</p>\n\n<p>What if the short squeeze mania spills out into the other heavily shorted stocks?</p>\n\n<p>Pretty concerning for CS because, I’ve also learned that Citadel Securities is responsible for processing about 25%-40% of ALL stock market transactions.</p>\n\n<p>So uh. What if they go bankrupt?</p>\n\n<p>I don’t mean to be speaking in extremes, but is this potentially a 2008 mortgage backed securities crisis type of situation?</p>\n\n<p>Serious educated answers would be sincerely appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l5y4s7/what_if_citadel_securities_goes_bankrupt/","title":"What if Citadel Securities goes bankrupt???","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-27T10:29:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-27 10:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l5y4s7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5y4s7/what_if_citadel_securities_goes_bankrupt/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5y4s7/what_if_citadel_securities_goes_bankrupt/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Troflecopter","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Troflecopter","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Troflecopter","score":64,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果城投证券破产了，怎么办？","the_new_excerpt":"我和我的朋友对这些人造成的负债进行了深入的研究。\n疯狂的空头挤压。\n\n我认为我们发现的是，如果这些空头挤压继续下去，并且。\n卖出它们的对冲基金破产，这些仓位最终将是。\n像Citadel这样的做市商的责任...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果城投證券破產了，怎麼辦？","the_new_excerpt":"我和我的朋友對這些人造成的負債進行了深入的研究。\n瘋狂的空頭擠壓。\n\n我認爲我們發現的是，如果這些空頭擠壓繼續下去，並且。\n賣出它們的對沖基金破產，這些倉位最終將是。\n像Citadel這樣的做市商的責任...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ldttra","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldttra/the_year_is_2063/","title":"The Year is 2063","date":"February 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"今年是2063年","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"今年是2063年","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ldotlc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldotlc/what_if_i_told_you/","title":"What if I told you","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果我告诉你","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果我告訴你","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l5y4s7","previousId":"RedditPost-ldttra","nextId":"RedditPost-ldotlc","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l5y4s7/what_if_citadel_securities_goes_bankrupt/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
