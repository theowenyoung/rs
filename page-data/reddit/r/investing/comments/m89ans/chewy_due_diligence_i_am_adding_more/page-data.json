The pandemic was a driving factor for the growth we saw take place this year with Chewy adding over <strong>5 million new users</strong>. They reported positive growth quarter after quarter leading up to the pandemic (they were poised for success and executed perfectly), in addition to a hopeful outlook on customer retention moving forward as a result of covid. Who wants to switch back to lugging bags of pet food around? They will also benefit from the generational &quot;trendiness&quot; of the company as they continue to grow and expand their services. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Just order from Chewy&quot;. I remember my dad always telling me to &quot;just order from amazon&quot; whenever I wanted something I could not find in stores. He would also advocate for using the service due to their unbeatable prices. The fast delivery was but a bonus as I would have preferred to go to the store and buy my item right away (if it was something I was excited about/wanted). I guess my point here is that pet food really is not all that exciting. It is more of a necessity than a want. If Chewy can compete with in store prices, who in their right mind would go out for pet food? Just order from Chewy and forget about it right? Amazon was but a book store....</p>\n\n<h1>In the works....</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Compounding -</strong> this is service offered by Chewy&#39;s pharmacy where they customize pet medications to meet specific needs of individual pets. Some animals can only take certain medications in a liquid form or require very specific doses or formulations of a particular drug. Their pharmacy will formulate these medications to meet a vets request for a pet and can deliver said formulation for consumption. They plan to eventually offer this service directly to vets so they can offer the service to their &quot;in house&quot; patients. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Connect with a vet -</strong> pretty self explanatory but has more implications than meets the eye....once they have the ability to consolidate their customers needs into one service, hopefully their own service, I believe the revenue jump will be huge. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Some key figures -</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>2.8% in net sales increase per customer ($363/customer)</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>5 mil new users added in 2020 (40% increase YOY)</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>25.5 gross margin (increase by 180-basis points as they spend less on customer acquisition and see an increase in brand recognition)</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Free Cash Flow positive at 32.9 mil compared to -12.8 mil the year before</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Net Cash from operating activities up to 63.4 mil from only 1.6 mil the year before</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Ownership is an interesting topic here. Back in 2019 Chewy was acquired by BC Partners who also owns PetSmart. They own approximately 63% of the company. BC Partners acquired Chewy as a strategic move after seeing revenues slip due to losing market share to the online retailer. Chewy is NOT a subsidiary of PetSmart or vice versa. BC Partners own each of them separately. </p>\n\n<p>Technical Analysis - consolidation in the 50-60 price range was very strong...this is where i started my position and have been tracking support and resistance for some time now familiarizing myself with the stocks movements. The price peak back in September to around 75 created a strong level for us to monitor. The 75 resistance was broken, followed by strong price action to the upside. We are now coming back down to test the 75 level for new support before pushing higher. The weekly chart is in play, using the 180/200 ma as a buy level. </p>\n\n<p>Chewy was modelled with Amazon in mind. The CEO stated that he used the 1997 letter to shareholders by Jeff Bezos to model the building of his company. This has proven to be very true as they offer 1-2 day delivery for orders over $50, prices beat out brick and mortar stores, the bonuses and discounts for signing up and sticking with them, as well as their expansion into different fields of pet care. Chewy customer service is outstanding, something not even Amazon can compete with for the time being. The personalization is second to none. Chewy also has a 1 year return window vs Amazon&#39;s 1 month window. Chewy&#39;s pharmacy is something Amazon does not have. Amazon may sell flee or tick medications, but they do not fill scripts. With purchase experience varying with Amazon from one experience to the next due to different dealings with vendors and individual sellers, the experience for the customer at Chewy is one Amazon simply can not compete with. </p>\n\n<p>We may see some minor pull back in revenues as the 2020 surge may be hard to keep up with. Will this effect the stock price in a negative way? Possibly. But i doubt it. I believe this is being priced in as we speak. The long term outlook does not change. I believe this company will continue to grow over time and will continue to increase their margins and revenues.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m89ans/chewy_due_diligence_i_am_adding_more/","title":"Chewy Due Diligence - I am adding more!","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-19T11:24:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-19 11:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m89ans","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m89ans/chewy_due_diligence_i_am_adding_more/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m89ans/chewy_due_diligence_i_am_adding_more/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"mrfilthynasty4141","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mrfilthynasty4141","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"mrfilthynasty4141","score":152,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"咀嚼式消化器\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n2020年收入，收入按年增长%。\n\n\n\n2020年10月31日 1.78亿元 44.9%+ 2020年7月31日 1.70亿元 47.31%+ 2020年4月30日 1.62亿元\n46.17%+ 2020年1月31日 1.35亿...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"咀嚼式消化器\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n2020年收入，收入按年增長%。\n\n\n\n2020年10月31日 1.78億元 44.9%+ 2020年7月31日 1.70億元 47.31%+ 2020年4月30日 1.62億元\n46.17%+ 2020年1月31日 1.35億...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mogxnp","excerpt":"Some of the traders I follow say things like \"over $125 can see $132\" or \"over\n$367 stock XYZ can explode.\" More often than not, the price action plays out\njust as predicted.\n\nIn these examples, are the prices being referenced just major resistance levels?\nIf this is the case, are these levels…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mogxnp/stock_needs_over_price_x_to_see_price_y_are_these/","title":"\"Stock needs over price x to see price y\" - are these prices just resistance levels?","date":"April 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"\"Stock needs over price x to see price y\" - これらの価格は単なる抵抗線でしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"私がフォローしているトレーダーの中には、「125ドルを超えれば132ドルも見えてくる」とか「367ドルを超えれば株XYZは爆発する」などと言う人がいます。\n367ドルを超えるとXYZの株は爆発する」などと言います。多くの場合、予測通りの値動きをします。\n予測通りになることが多いです。\n\nこれらの例では、参照されている価格は単なる主要な抵抗レベルでしょうか？\nもしそうだとしたら、そのレベルは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"股票需要超过价格x才能看到价格y\"--这些价格只是阻力位吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我关注的一些交易员说：\"超过125美元可以看到132美元 \"或 \"超过\n367美元的股票XYZ可以爆发。\" 更多的时候，价格走势表现为\n就像预测的那样。\n\n在这些例子中，被参考的价格是否只是主要阻力位？\n如果是这样，这些水平... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"股票需要超過價格x才能看到價格y\"--這些價格只是阻力位嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我關注的一些交易員說：\"超過125美元可以看到132美元 \"或 \"超過\n367美元的股票XYZ可以爆發。\" 更多的時候，價格走勢表現爲\n就像預測的那樣。\n\n在這些例子中，被參考的價格是否只是主要阻力位？\n如果是這樣，這些水平... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1380894191643938819","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1380894191643938819","title":"From its peak $1,422 in January 2018, Ethereum fell over 94% to a low of $83 in December 2018. \n\nIt has since rallied 2,523%, hitting another new high of $2,195 today.\n\n$ETH https://t.co/TrU0O5tbt5","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 11, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"2018年1月のピーク1,422ドルから、イーサリアムは94％以上下落し、2018年12月には83ドルの安値を記録しました。\n\nその後、2,523%の上昇を見せ、本日も2,195ドルの新高値を更新しています。\n\n$ETH https://t.co/TrU0O5tbt5","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"从2018年1月的峰值1,422美元开始，Ethereum在2018年12月跌至83美元的低点，跌幅超过94%。\n\n此后，它已经反弹了2523%，今天又创下了2195美元的新高。\n\n$ETH https://t.co/TrU0O5tbt5","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"從2018年1月的峯值1,422美元開始，Ethereum在2018年12月跌至83美元的低點，跌幅超過94%。\n\n此後，它已經反彈了2523%，今天又創下了2195美元的新高。\n\n$ETH https://t.co/TrU0O5tbt5","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m89ans","previousId":"RedditPost-mogxnp","nextId":"TweetPost-1380894191643938819","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m89ans/chewy_due_diligence_i_am_adding_more/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
