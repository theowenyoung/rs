Currently I have about 9K in my Roth IRA, and 11K in my 401k,  with plans to move much of that 401k money into my Roth so it can be maxed out.</p>\n\n<p>My main questions are what exactly should I read to have more confidence in what I am doing, what should I be investing in, and should I use their roboinvestor (Even with the fees).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of my options are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Switch to the Robo advisor, with its 0.35% fee, which seems beatable to me, but I and all of my family use Chase, so it would be convenient, and I do already kinda like YouInvest. I think vanguard is like 10% of this rate fwiw, so it seems suboptimal, although I am taking on a lot of risk managing things myself.</li>\n<li>Buy mutual funds via my Chase account, my understanding is that I will not be charged a fee whatsoever for these trades [Source: <a href=\"https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/online-investing/pricing\">https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/online-investing/pricing</a>] and this would only charge me whatever fee the mutual fund charges.\n\n<ol>\n<li>I would presumably go with something like  TTIIX, as that is what my job put my 401k into, although they also underperformed the SP500 by quite a bit. Their fee is  0.100% [Source: <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/ttiix/quote\">https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/ttiix/quote</a>]</li>\n<li>I could also just buy VTSAX, that seems like a semi-reasonable plan.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Continue my manual buying of stocks and mutual funds I like, regardless of how risky it seems.\n\n<ol>\n<li>This seems dangerous to me, my current intuition on stocks has me about at the following ratios.\n\n<ol>\n<li>40% SPYG</li>\n<li>25% VTSAX and the Schwab equivalent (I was YouTube researching on separate days and both ended up suggested.</li>\n<li>15% ARKK</li>\n<li>15% Ford (Hey, I made 85%)</li>\n<li>5% AAPL</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Basically my concerns are the level of risk I am taking, and the amount that I will pay for expert advice on my little bit of money.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
