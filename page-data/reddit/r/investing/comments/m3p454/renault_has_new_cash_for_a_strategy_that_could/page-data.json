On top of that Nissan (owned by Renault in a 43%) will release Nissan Ariya soon, and the Renault Megane Evision will follow next this year.</p>\n\n<p>Both Nissan Ariya and Megane Evision will use for the first time the new dedicated EV platform which some position as even better than the one from VW. This year probably will be presented the new Alpine premium and only EV brand models. Besides, they have also announced other EV cars like the Renault R5 and R4 for 2023-2024.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, Renault possibly will still have a hard year for restrictions for COVID and semiconductors shortage, but with Luca de Meo leading and a very well positioned EV platform, the current valuation maybe will be hard to understand in a not very long future.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/renault-has-new-cash-for-a-strategy-that-could-make-it-an-undervalued-ev-play-says-ubs-11615565876?siteid=yhoof2\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/renault-has-new-cash-for-a-strategy-that-could-make-it-an-undervalued-ev-play-says-ubs-11615565876?siteid=yhoof2</a></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Renault announced on Friday that it had successfully sold its entire  ownership stake in Mercedes-Benz-owner, reaping €1.14 billion ($1.4  billion) from nearly 16.5 million shares sold at €69.50 per share. The  sale represents 1.54% of Daimler’s share capital sold at a near 4%  discount, based on the stock price at the close on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>UBS upgraded Renault from neutral to buy on March 2 and increased the  12-month target price on the stock from €22 to €54. Based on the share  price on Friday, this means the stock has legs to climb nearly 37%  higher, according to UBS.</p>\n\n<p>Should the stock market come to appreciate Renault’s EV strategy, UBS  said, this could trigger a rerating of the stock from between double the  current rating to six times the current rating, depending on the  valuation metric used.</p>\n\n<p>The company has “all the tools to sell competitive EV products in a cost  efficient manner,” the analysts said, with its design platform on par  with market-leader Volkswagen’s. In addition, UBS said that a key  differentiator for Renault compared with other manufacturers is that the  company is past its research and development peak, with a  fully-dedicated EV platform already built.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m3p454/renault_has_new_cash_for_a_strategy_that_could/","title":"Renault has new cash for a strategy that could make it an undervalued EV play","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-13T15:57:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-13 15:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m3p454","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m3p454/renault_has_new_cash_for_a_strategy_that_could/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m3p454/renault_has_new_cash_for_a_strategy_that_could/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"logos88","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/logos88","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"logos88","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"雷诺有了新的现金战略，可以使其成为被低估的电动车玩法","the_new_excerpt":"似乎雷诺可能会浮现他的价值与他的14亿美元的销售\n价值10亿美元的股份在戴姆勒，同时加强他的位置，作为一个电动车的\n生产商。\n\n他们刚刚推出了达契亚Spring，这是欧洲最便宜的电动车，也是一款非常的。\n可能的顶级卖家的细节和公司。最重要的是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"雷諾有了新的現金戰略，可以使其成爲被低估的電動車玩法","the_new_excerpt":"似乎雷諾可能會浮現他的價值與他的14億美元的銷售\n價值10億美元的股份在戴姆勒，同時加強他的位置，作爲一個電動車的\n生產商。\n\n他們剛剛推出了達契亞Spring，這是歐洲最便宜的電動車，也是一款非常的。\n可能的頂級賣家的細節和公司。最重要的是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mgzbrc","excerpt":"To whom it may concern: (I’m aware most of you know how to properly diversify).\n\nI see some investors on here being invested in multiple tech equities, APPL,\nTSLA, AMZN, SONO etc. and talking about how well diversified their portfolio is.\n\nJust a quick reminder than having a diversified portfolio…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mgzbrc/quick_reminder_having_a_portfolio_consisting_of/","title":"Quick Reminder: Having a portfolio consisting of different tech stocks does not mean you have a ‘Diversified Portfolio’","date":"March 31, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"快速提醒。拥有一个由不同科技股组成的投资组合并不意味着你有一个 \"多元化的投资组合","the_new_excerpt":"对可能关心的人来说。(我知道你们大多数人都知道如何适当分散投资).\n\n我在这里看到一些投资者被投资于多只科技股，APPL。\nTSLA，AMZN，SONO等，并谈论他们的投资组合是多么的多元化。\n\n只是简单的提醒一下，比起拥有多元化的投资组合......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"快速提醒。擁有一個由不同科技股組成的投資組合並不意味着你有一個 \"多元化的投資組合","the_new_excerpt":"對可能關心的人來說。(我知道你們大多數人都知道如何適當分散投資).\n\n我在這裏看到一些投資者被投資於多隻科技股，APPL。\nTSLA，AMZN，SONO等，並談論他們的投資組合是多麼的多元化。\n\n只是簡單的提醒一下，比起擁有多元化的投資組合......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mh2x3s","excerpt":"I don't know who needs to read this but I think it's a very important message to\nhear.
