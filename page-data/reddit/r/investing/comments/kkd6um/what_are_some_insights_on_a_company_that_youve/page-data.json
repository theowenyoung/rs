Even though software engineering is a field where it&#39;s notoriously hard to determine who is actually a skilled engineer, there is the possibility that PLTR has the best and brightest software engineers out of most tech companies.</p>\n\n<p>Unity software isn&#39;t just for video games. But it has potential to be extended to creating all manner of interactive 3D software in general. For example doing VR training simulation for jobs, or VR education (traveling back to ancient Rome in a history class). The bull case would be that Unity eventually becomes the Adobe for 3D interactive content.</p>\n\n<p>Lemonade plans on releasing new insurance products every 6-8 months (based off of the latest interview I&#39;ve watched with the CEO). Their software is designed in such a way that it is easy to do this. A lot of people who&#39;ve done preliminary research on Lemonade, believes that they just do renter&#39;s insurance and are sticking with that. But 3 months ago they&#39;ve released pet insurance. They&#39;re planning on releasing life insurance next month, and then there&#39;s the possibility of car insurance afterwards.  The CEO has also stated that he understands the importance of intersecting humanity&#39;s (art/design) with tech, and that this is a valuable way to capture one of the most scarce commodities, mindshare. Which is why the &quot;Lemonade app&#39;s workflow looks and feels a lot better than going on Geico, Statefarm, Allstate, etc...&quot; (CFO&#39;s words, not mine).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Yeah a lot of people may be aware of these facts, but I think most investors <em>might</em> not be aware of them. Also I was just trying to give examples.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kkd6um/what_are_some_insights_on_a_company_that_youve/","title":"What are some insights on a company that you've researched that you think most people might not be aware of?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 26, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-26T15:48:44.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-26 15:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kkd6um","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kkd6um/what_are_some_insights_on_a_company_that_youve/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kkd6um/what_are_some_insights_on_a_company_that_youve/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Okmanl","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Okmanl","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Okmanl","score":88,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对于一家你研究过的公司，有哪些你认为大多数人可能没有意识到的洞察力？","the_new_excerpt":"示例：\n\n据推测，帕兰提尔的面试过程是所有面试过程中最艰难的\n科技公司，包括谷歌、亚马逊、Facebook、Netflix等。甚至\n虽然软件工程是出了名的很难确定\n他实际上是一名熟练的工程师，这就是…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對於一家你研究過的公司，有哪些你認爲大多數人可能沒有意識到的洞察力？","the_new_excerpt":"示例：\n\n據推測，帕蘭提爾的面試過程是所有面試過程中最艱難的\n科技公司，包括谷歌、亞馬遜、Facebook、Netflix等。甚至\n雖然軟件工程是出了名的很難確定\n他實際上是一名熟練的工程師，這就是…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l0khnn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0khnn/bb_getting_recognized_thanks_to_wsb/","title":"$BB getting recognized thanks to WSB","date":"January 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"巴恩斯B得到认可，感谢WSB","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"巴恩斯B得到認可，感謝WSB","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l0s6nr","excerpt":"I'd like to bring attention to the fucking work these gay mods are putting in on\nthis sub.\n\nToday alone I've seen multiple posts by illiterate losers trying to shill the\nidea of shorting GME and just spreading false bullshit DD (or no DD at all).\nThank you mods for keeping this subreddit full of…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0s6nr/shoutout_to_you_gay_mods/","title":"Shoutout to You Gay Mods","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 20, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"向各位同志版主致敬","the_new_excerpt":"我想让大家注意一下这些同志版主们的工作。\n这个子。\n\n仅今天我就看到了多个文盲屌丝发的帖子，试图推销的是\n做空GME的想法，只是散布虚假的废话DD（或者根本没有DD）。\n感谢版主让这个子reddit充满...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"向各位同志版主致敬","the_new_excerpt":"我想讓大家注意一下這些同志版主們的工作。\n這個子。\n\n僅今天我就看到了多個文盲屌絲髮的帖子，試圖推銷的是\n做空GME的想法，只是散佈虛假的廢話DD（或者根本沒有DD）。\n感謝版主讓這個子reddit充滿...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kkd6um","previousId":"RedditPost-l0khnn","nextId":"RedditPost-l0s6nr","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kkd6um/what_are_some_insights_on_a_company_that_youve/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
