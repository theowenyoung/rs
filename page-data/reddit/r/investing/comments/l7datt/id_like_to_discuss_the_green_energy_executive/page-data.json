President Biden issued multiple climate change related executive orders yesterday, some with potentially big implications for the market.</p>\n\n<p>Big highlights:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Replace federal vehicle fleets with EVs (good for EVs, energy storage tech, bad for traditional car companies and fossil fuel companies)</p></li>\n<li><p>Remove subsidies from fossil fuel companies (potentially huge impact on fuel companies, drillers, refiners, car companies, and more depending on what subsidies are targeted)</p></li>\n<li><p>Redirect fossil fuel subsidies to clean energy initiatives and to incentivize green companies (great news for renewable energy companies, possible help for solar companies and installers?)</p></li>\n<li><p>Pause new oil/gas drilling leases (negative impact to fossil fuel drillers, and fossil fuel exploration)</p></li>\n<li><p>Massive grid improvements to deal with new sources of industry (utility plays here? Durable equipment plays for things like transformers?)</p></li>\n<li><p>Double offshore wind energy production by 2030 (wind energy play)</p></li>\n<li><p>A new civilian climate corps to help with cleaning forests, waterways (potentially good for fishery and forestry plays)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just curious who else had seen this, and what your thoughts are.
