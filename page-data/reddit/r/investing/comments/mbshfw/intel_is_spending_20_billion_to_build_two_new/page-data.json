Intel said its foundry subsidiary will be called Intel Foundry Services and will be led by Randhir Thakur, a current Intel senior vice president.</p>\n\n<p>Gelsinger said the foundry business will compete in a market potentially worth $100 billion by 2025 and will manufacture a range of chips, including chips based on ARM technology, which are used in mobile devices, and has historically competed with Intel’s favored x86 technology.</p>\n\n<p>A slide displayed by Intel suggested that companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm could be customers for the business.
