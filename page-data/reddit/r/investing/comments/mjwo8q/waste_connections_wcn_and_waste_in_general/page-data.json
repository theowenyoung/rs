It is an extensive ecosystem which is the backbone underpinning a growing economy. Waste Connections operations stand to materially benefit from the industrial and residential waste offshoot in light of Biden’s infrastructure plan, which targets growth in transportation and logistics in and to secondary markets (in which WCN dominates): </p>\n\n<p><em>“The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days.  It’ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports.” –</em> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/\"><em>Biden speech on American Jobs Plan, March 31 2021</em></a></p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the plan aims for a complete overhaul of critical infrastructure including the replacement of all lead water piping. Biden aims to further jumpstart American manufacturing output by increasing factories in primary and secondary markets. The industrial and residential waste byproduct of Biden’s plan will materially increase collection and processing volumes at municipal an non-municipal solid waste landfills, of which WCN owns and operates 74 in secondary regions.</p>\n\n<p>WCN focuses on secondary and rural markets as opposed to urban cities, and is able to achieve industry leading margins due to lack of competition resulting in strong pricing power and low customer churn. Over 40% of solid waste revenues are generated under exclusive arrangements (Residential: 7 years or longer for rural; municipal shorter in nature and have competitive bidding process — Commercial, industrial, and E&amp;P service agreements typically range from 1-5 years). WCN vertically integrates its waste collection business with owning and operating landfills and transfer stations in key markets which further serves as a strategic advantage, capping competition. </p>\n\n<p>It maintains incredible pricing power drives single digit annual increases to recurring revenues; 13.1% CAGR since 2014; and industry leading free cash flow and earnings margins vs. peers. </p>\n\n<p>In sum, WCN is a high-quality, defensive name providing an essential service in an increasingly competitive environment. Given its industry-leading growth profile, robust (and sustainable) FCF generation, and dominance of secondary markets, you should consider the company a core holding and a safe play against volatility. It continues to innovate in the recycling and green energy conversion space, both catalysts to future growth and investment. As economies continue to open and the world resumes full-tilt, expect volumes and earnings growth to catapult. </p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://latecycle.com/2021/04/04/waste-connections-the-backbone-of-an-infrastructure-economy/\">https://latecycle.com/2021/04/04/waste-connections-the-backbone-of-an-infrastructure-economy/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mjwo8q/waste_connections_wcn_and_waste_in_general/","title":"Waste Connections (WCN) and waste in general: Material beneficiaries of Biden's infrastructure policies","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"April 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-04T15:52:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-04 15:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mjwo8q","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mjwo8q/waste_connections_wcn_and_waste_in_general/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mjwo8q/waste_connections_wcn_and_waste_in_general/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"LostInAntiquity","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LostInAntiquity","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"LostInAntiquity","score":628,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"废物连接（WCN）和一般废物。拜登的基础设施政策的物质受益者","the_new_excerpt":"废物处理行业不仅仅是辛勤工作的绅士和妇女收集\n从您的家庭或企业的垃圾。它是一个广泛的生态系统，是\n支撑经济增长的骨干力量。废物联接公司的业务可以\n实质性地受益于工业和生活垃圾的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"廢物連接（WCN）和一般廢物。拜登的基礎設施政策的物質受益者","the_new_excerpt":"廢物處理行業不僅僅是辛勤工作的紳士和婦女收集\n從您的家庭或企業的垃圾。它是一個廣泛的生態系統，是\n支撐經濟增長的骨幹力量。廢物聯接公司的業務可以\n實質性地受益於工業和生活垃圾的...","locale":"zh-Hant"},{"title":"WCN（Waste Connections）や廃棄物全般について。Bidenのインフラ政策の重要な受益者","the_new_excerpt":"廃棄物産業は、単にゴミを集める働き者の紳士・淑女ではありません。\nご家庭や会社からゴミを回収するだけではありません。広大な生態系を形成しています。\n成長する経済を支えています。ウェストコネクションズの事業は\n産業廃棄物と家庭廃棄物から多大な利益を得ることができます...","locale":"ja-JA"},{"title":"WCN（Waste Connections）や廃棄物全般について。Bidenのインフラ政策の重要な受益者","the_new_excerpt":"廃棄物産業は、単にゴミを集める働き者の紳士・淑女ではありません。\nご家庭や会社からゴミを回収するだけではありません。広大な生態系を形成しています。\n成長する経済を支えています。ウェストコネクションズの事業は\n産業廃棄物と家庭廃棄物から多大な利益を得ることができます...","locale":"ja"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n3vlr0","excerpt":"$NOK has the potential to reach $10+, here's why:\n\n\nREVENUE AND EARNINGS BEAT\n\nNet sales rose 3% year-over-year to €5.08 billion ($6.2 billion), beating the\nFactSet consensus for sales of €4.75 billion.
