For instance, if I look into MSFT, I can see that 127 institutional funds bough stocks in MSFT and 27 sold stocks. </p>\n\n<p>What I would like to do with this analysis is to find stocks that institutional investors are currently buying a lot. </p>\n\n<p>Does someone know what would be the best approach to do this? I thought about running the script for a bunch of companies and compare them together. But that approach does not make sense because obviously, large market-cap companies will attract more transactions than small-cap companies and they may not be really comparable.</p>\n\n<p>In case any of you is interested on how to get institutional investor transactions using Python, I have a video showing step by step:\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy_KtPGGTEk\">Analysing Institutional Investor Transactions!</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ljpowg/analysing_institutional_investor_transactions/","title":"Analysing Institutional Investor Transactions","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T17:37:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 17:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ljpowg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ljpowg/analysing_institutional_investor_transactions/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ljpowg/analysing_institutional_investor_transactions/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"jomarca23","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jomarca23","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jomarca23","score":905,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"分析机构投资者交易","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我想到了一个提取机构投资者交易的好方法\n使用Python的API来分析投资者是买入还是卖出。\n某公司的股票。\n\n例如，下面的表格是显示以下公司进行交易的结果\n机构投资者...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"分析機構投資者交易","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我想到了一個提取機構投資者交易的好方法\n使用Python的API來分析投資者是買入還是賣出。\n某公司的股票。\n\n例如，下面的表格是顯示以下公司進行交易的結果\n機構投資者...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lur27s","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lur27s/gme_explained_via_smash_ultimate/","title":"GME explained via Smash Ultimate","date":"March 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME通过Smash Ultimate解释","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME通過Smash Ultimate解釋","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-luxx2q","excerpt":"I have seen many people not buy stocks due to the price being too high or vice\nversa.
