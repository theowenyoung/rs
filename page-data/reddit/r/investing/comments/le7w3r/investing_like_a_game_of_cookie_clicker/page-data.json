Its like DRIP, except when you DRIP you are buying the stock when it is the farthest possible away from payout another dividend. This way you use the dividends from other stocks to buy stocks that are closer to the ex-dividend date. Ideally in this strategy you would want to have a list of stocks such that there is always one of them close to their ex-dividend date.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/le7w3r/investing_like_a_game_of_cookie_clicker/","title":"Investing like a game of cookie clicker","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-07T04:01:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-07 04:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"le7w3r","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/le7w3r/investing_like_a_game_of_cookie_clicker/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/le7w3r/investing_like_a_game_of_cookie_clicker/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"johnhammondsexpenses","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/johnhammondsexpenses","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"johnhammondsexpenses","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"投资就像玩饼干点击游戏","the_new_excerpt":"我很无聊，所以我一直在玩弄的想法 投资于大量的股息。\n股票，使你总是得到一些钱滚滚而来，然后你什么\n做的是你递增使用这些钱买1股票的公司，是接近\n至其股息支付日。它就像DRIP，除了当你...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"投資就像玩餅乾點擊遊戲","the_new_excerpt":"我很無聊，所以我一直在玩弄的想法 投資於大量的股息。\n股票，使你總是得到一些錢滾滾而來，然後你什麼\n做的是你遞增使用這些錢買1股票的公司，是接近\n至其股息支付日。它就像DRIP，除了當你...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lo897z","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo897z/famed_charging_bull_sculptor_arturo_di_modica/","title":"Famed ‘Charging Bull’ sculptor Arturo Di Modica dies at 80 — Pour one out for our guy today","date":"February 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"著名的 \"冲锋陷阵的公牛 \"雕塑家Arturo Di Modica去世，享年80岁--今天为他倒一杯。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"著名的 \"衝鋒陷陣的公牛 \"雕塑家Arturo Di Modica去世，享年80歲--今天爲他倒一杯。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lodpnu","excerpt":"This community is god damn amazing.
