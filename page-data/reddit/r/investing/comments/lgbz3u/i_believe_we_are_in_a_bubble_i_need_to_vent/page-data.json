Why are they trading at 100x their top line?! Some companies are burning money like never before, have a smaller revenue than before, and are firing people left and right, but they still grew 700%. wtf. Take SPWR as an example, or LMND. I walk past the LMND offices every day, I met Shai Wininger in person. I&#39;m not going to rant about that specific company, but the market is disconnected from reality. LMND has 80M in revenue, burns money, doesn&#39;t grow, but tripled in value in 6 months. Why??</p>\n\n<p>Half of the stock charts that I&#39;m looking at seem normal and then in 2020 they shoot up like never before. You can let a 5 year old pick any 5 stocks and it would have netted you a 30% return on average, easy!</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s happening? This is unprecedented.</p>\n\n<p>I need someone to prove me wrong, or at least provide me with some rationale as to what is happening.</p>\n\n<p>With all of that said, I&#39;m still investing big on margin, but I&#39;m strongly considering changing my portfolio to things that I believe are more solid, and jump out of the 10x bandwagons. I made insane gains last year, but this party can&#39;t go on forever and it needs to come down to earth.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lgbz3u/i_believe_we_are_in_a_bubble_i_need_to_vent/","title":"I believe we are in a bubble [I need to vent...]","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T04:29:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 04:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lgbz3u","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lgbz3u/i_believe_we_are_in_a_bubble_i_need_to_vent/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lgbz3u/i_believe_we_are_in_a_bubble_i_need_to_vent/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ButtFlapMan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ButtFlapMan","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ButtFlapMan","score":239,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我相信我们是在泡沫中[我需要发泄...]。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我相信我們是在泡沫中[我需要發泄...]。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lr9nke","excerpt":"These daily discussions run from Monday to Friday including during our themed\nposts.\n\nSome helpful links:\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd] for charts, fundamentals, and\n   aggregated news on individual stocks\n * Bloomberg market news [https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n   *…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lr9nke/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_feb_24_2021/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Wednesday - Feb 24, 2021","date":"February 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"r/股票每日讨论 周三--2021年2月24日","the_new_excerpt":"每天的讨论从周一到周五，包括在我们的主题讨论期间，我们都会进行。\n岗位。\n\n一些有用的链接。\n\n * Finviz[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd]，提供图表、基本要素和\n   个股汇总\n * 彭博市场新闻[https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n   *…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/股票每日討論 週三--2021年2月24日","the_new_excerpt":"每天的討論從週一到週五，包括在我們的主題討論期間，我們都會進行。\n崗位。\n\n一些有用的鏈接。\n\n * Finviz[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd]，提供圖表、基本要素和\n   個股彙總\n * 彭博市場新聞[https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n   *…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lre2k6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lre2k6/gme_megathread_for_wednesday_february_24th_2021/","title":"GME Megathread for Wednesday, February 24th, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 24, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"2021年2月24日（星期三）GME Megathread。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年2月24日（星期三）GME Megathread。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lgbz3u","previousId":"RedditPost-lr9nke","nextId":"RedditPost-lre2k6","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lgbz3u/i_believe_we_are_in_a_bubble_i_need_to_vent/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
