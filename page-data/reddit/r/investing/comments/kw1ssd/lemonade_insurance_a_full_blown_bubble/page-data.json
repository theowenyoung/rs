I work in Venture Capital and am doing well at it.</p>\n\n<p>Lemonade caught my attention because I summarized the S1 in details at IPO, for my personal learning. The S1 specifically states that because of reinsurance - gross margin for the business is stuck closely around 20% (reinsurance basically provides a floor but also caps potential profit if loss ratios come down).</p>\n\n<p>Now - take a quick look at Bloomberg consensus. The company trades at 53x EV / 2022E Consensus Revenue as of tonight (yes, 53x FORWARD revenue)</p>\n\n<p>If we put a 20% gross margin on this revenue (because of reinsurance there is virtually no chance the company significantly exceeds that!) the company basically trades at 250x EV / 2022 Gross Profit.</p>\n\n<p>TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TIMES 2022E (normalised) GROSS PROFIT.</p>\n\n<p>I am speechless that the Motley Fool can recommend such a stock to its customers. This is beyond a bubble, in my view of course - but no one will change my mind here. My personal opinion is that this is bound to end badly in the next 2y (bar acquisition scenario, but I don’t see who would fork out 100x 2020 revenue for that business). Can anyone give me a valid reason not to go short, beyond the market’s current state?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kw1ssd/lemonade_insurance_a_full_blown_bubble/","title":"Lemonade Insurance: A Full Blown Bubble?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-13T01:55:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-13 01:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kw1ssd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kw1ssd/lemonade_insurance_a_full_blown_bubble/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kw1ssd/lemonade_insurance_a_full_blown_bubble/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Medallion74","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Medallion74","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Medallion74","score":917,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"柠檬水保险。全面爆发的泡沫？","the_new_excerpt":"首先我想说的是，我相信/理解主题投资...
