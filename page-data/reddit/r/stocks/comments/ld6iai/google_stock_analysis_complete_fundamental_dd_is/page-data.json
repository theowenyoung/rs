Let’s start by talking a little about <a href=\"https://ibb.co/NC5sqGv\">Alphabet</a>, they are one of the biggest companies in the world that generates most of their revenues and income from online advertising services provided through their platforms like Google Search &amp; YT while also expanding into multiple other businesses like cloud services and autonomous driving technology through their venture Waymo.</p>\n\n<p>The company was founded during the dot com bubble in 1998 and has more than 130K employees, with the company performing quite well in the past year gaining more than 30%.</p>\n\n<p>I believe Google will continue to <a href=\"https://ibb.co/S6x0XHc\">grow</a> as their cloud platform will remain one of the biggest in the world, while also continuing to innovate and develop other emerging businesses that might turn out successful in the long-term, while their main competition is Baidu &amp; Bing for the search engine, but their market share is still completely dominant, as they also compete with social networks &amp; online retailers for advertising placements.</p>\n\n<p>So, guys, let’s go a little through the 4th quarter &amp; yearly results for Google.</p>\n\n<p>Google smashed <a href=\"https://ibb.co/4jSwJVr\">earnings</a> expectations for the 4th quarter with a beat of more than $6 on EPS and $4B in total revenues.</p>\n\n<p>The company <a href=\"https://ibb.co/T24JLqY\">reported</a> a revenue of almost $57B in the 4th quarter while generating revenues of over $182B in 2020, representing a 12% increase over 2019 as they operating income also grew to over $40B for the first time despite a very slow start to the year through the first 2 quarters as their ad revenues were crushed due to the lack of travel &amp; other leisure industries as those are some of the biggest advertiser income streams for them.</p>\n\n<p>The company sustained a significant growth rate in the past year in their 2 major income segments, with their services business which grew by 11%, and the cloud services which also more than doubled their revenues, but the cloud services is still losing money as they keep investing into expanding their services to compete with the other major cloud players like Amazon, Microsoft &amp; Alibaba.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Cmpx7vs\">company</a> has also started this quarter to report their google cloud results separately to give a more detailed view on how the company is performing, as we can now see how the company has managed to increase their revenues streams and how big the YT Ads revenues have become for them as those increased by 30% in the last year. Meanwhile the revenues from Google Search also rose by 6% and the Cloud Segment spiked by 46%, as they also have a big backlog in this segment.</p>\n\n<p>So <a href=\"https://ibb.co/r4p6F1Z\">overall</a>, the company has managed to increase their revenues in constant currency by 14% in the past year while also improving their operating margin by 2%.</p>\n\n<p>Google has managed to keep growing and improving their business operation through major capital expenditures that have accounted for over $22B in 2020. I believe the big spending on capex is really needed, as the competition in the cloud segment in really heating up, so I like companies that keep reinvesting into themselves, as they have also spent over $27B on R&amp;D in 2020, as they keep investing into most of their products and adding new ones in the pipeline.</p>\n\n<p>Also, for the projections of the DCF it’s important to <a href=\"https://ibb.co/vxtbZcZ\">NOTE</a> that they had over $13B in Depreciation &amp; Amortization in 2020, with this number growing between 15-30% in the past 2 years so I while use a 15% increase for the DCF to be safe. The other big number that is important is their overall capex spending, which has gone down in the past 3 years, but as things might ramp up again as they mentioned in their earnings call, I will continue to grow this spending by 2.5%/year expecting things to normalize after the company went for a safer approach in 2020.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/7GQTZS6\">Alphabet</a> also managed to increase their earnings before interest &amp; tax or EBIT which stood at over $41B while also buying back 1.6% of their total shares in the past year, as they continued buyback <a href=\"https://ibb.co/c8LKM1g\">programs</a> in the 4th quarter of 2020, buying back over 4.7M shares in just the last 3 months, thus continuing to reward their shareholders even more.</p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of negative outlooks for the company though, as their <a href=\"https://ibb.co/7vGjYwW\">effective</a> tax rate has increased in the past years, and this might continue to go higher depending on future tax reforms so I will take into account some small raises in the tax rate.</p>\n\n<p>The next problem is the regulatory pressure which can be another bump in the road for Google, but I mostly expect things to drag along and may eventually end with something similar to what happened to Microsoft. Even If they somehow end up breaking their businesses, I think we can see the Cloud business trading at insane P/Es which would increase the actual value of the resulting stocks, while the search engine and YT will remain very powerful even without the contracts with OEMs, which would result in better margins and less operating expenses, as most people would still turn to Google for their searches and videos.</p>\n\n<p>The final problem for Google is the privacy issues, but it seems they have found a way to substitute the traditional cookie technology with a new software interface called Federated Learning of Cohorts.</p>\n\n<p>This technology seems to have at least 95% of the same power of conversion per dollar compared to cookies which would be a huge boost to their privacy issues concerns and will help them maintain their dominance in the online ad’s world.</p>\n\n<p>But this isn’t the only technology Alphabet is trying to develop, they still have other proposals in works as well, which might come in even better, so we will have to wait and see what they go with.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Google also offered some <a href=\"https://ibb.co/NKwgyH2\">guidance</a> for 2021 as they expect easy comps in the first half of 2021, while they are planning to ramp up the pace of investments this year.</p>\n\n<p>They also expect to keep investing in cloud segment as their <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Ks6TNWq\">backlog</a> which stands at $30B is mostly attributable to the cloud segment, as Alphabet will continue to focus on long-term growth that will benefit them in the long run as operating results &amp; margins go.</p>\n\n<p>For the price targets, I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…</p>\n\n<p>So, let’s start with the discounted free cash flow <a href=\"https://ibb.co/fpRmHnk\">PROJECTIONS</a> to see what the current valuation of the company is.</p>\n\n<p>I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later in the long-term projection, and the net income for 2020, to which I added back the Depreciation &amp; Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to an EBITDA of almost $55B</p>\n\n<p>For the next years I used a small increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and also applied a 10% decrease in their net working capital.</p>\n\n<p>I increased the capex spending and their D&amp;A as I previously mentioned, so, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the average SP500 return in the past decades and is what I like to use as a discount rate, given the current low interest rates, we get almost $190B Discounted Free Cash Flows by 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt of the company, which in this case stand at a net $200B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though most of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach.</p>\n\n<p>If we do use the growth approach, we can see that GOOG is slightly overvalued right now, as this implies a loss of about 5%.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, a good EBITDA multiple for the company I think is about 20, as the stock currently trades over this multiple, but for safety reasons, I think 20 is pretty reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>And given this multiple &amp; approach we get a valuation of over $2700, or a 32% undervaluation of the company.</p>\n\n<p>But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for Alphabet in 2021 is $2326, implying a 13.3% return from the last price.</p>\n\n<p>Guys, next let’s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for Google.</p>\n\n<p>For my <a href=\"https://ibb.co/W0Lp2W8\">PROJECTIONS</a> I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream.</p>\n\n<p>I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the Cloud segment for 2021 as businesses keep needing cloud services more &amp; more, and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth rate.</p>\n\n<p>For the Google Services (which include Search, YT &amp; other revenue streams) I implied a 12% growth, just above last years, as YT keeps booming and the leisure industry advertising will slowly come back. But, for reasonable purposes I also implied a gradual slowdown of this trend by 1% each year.</p>\n\n<p>I believe these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high market share in the search segment and the demand for cloud services platforms.</p>\n\n<p>The 2 other revenues streams which are Other Bets &amp; Hedging I pretty much left unchanged as they don’t really have that big implications on the final number, but I did add a small amount of growth in both of them.</p>\n\n<p>For their cost of sales, I started from the current ones and maintained them for 3 of their segments, while for the Google Cloud cost of sales I implied a gradual improvement of about 14%/year. So, I am implying they reach profitability by 2024 and reach somewhat of an AWS type of profitability by 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Guys, if we add all of these up, it means for 2025 we would get over $334B in revenues and $237B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $97B.</p>\n\n<p>I also <a href=\"https://ibb.co/kJxShSy\">maintained</a> the same capex as in the DCF while for the interest income &amp; other incomes which stood at almost $7B this year I implied small annual growths, thus leading us to a $75.4B in earnings before tax.</p>\n\n<p>I also slightly <a href=\"https://ibb.co/rHNCn0d\">increased</a> their 16.3% effective tax rate to about 17.5% by 2025 in order to somewhat account for possible tax changes in the future and also accounted for some share buyback programs of about 1% each year.</p>\n\n<p>So, for the $62B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 653M shares, that would mean a $95.25 earnings/share, meaning the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/1vws94Z\">stock</a> is trading at almost 22 times forward price to earnings for 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Guys, for my personal projections I like to use Forward/PE valuations &amp; multiples, so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $2381 and $3810.</p>\n\n<p>After all these estimates what are my price targets?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/JthYJF1\">HERE</a> are my actual price targets… I think the 2025 bear case price we can see Google trade at is $2619 which would imply a return of 27.5%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Google will trade at 3095$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 50% return on the current price. </p>\n\n<p>My most bullish case though, would see the company trading at $3572, which would imply a return of almost 74%. </p>\n\n<p>So yeah guys, these are my Overall price <a href=\"https://ibb.co/GFPxV3K\">TARGETS</a> for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.</p>\n\n<p>I think these are pretty reasonable targets, as the cloud services will continue to boom in the next decades, while they will also benefit from an increased reach for their search engine and booming YT platform as more people are getting internet access each day, and we shouldn’t forget that they might have even more great products in the pipeline with interesting names like Waymo.</p>\n\n<p>Alphabet also has very good <a href=\"https://ibb.co/vL0VccC\">financials</a>, with almost $320B in assets vs just $97B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by the current $137B in cash, cash equivalents &amp; marketable securities.</p>\n\n<p>I also like to take a look at what the estimates are from the other analysts, and in this case, we can see an average EPS <a href=\"https://ibb.co/NYdX76f\">estimate</a> by 2025 of $117, which is way higher than my $95 EPS estimates.</p>\n\n<p>The analysts also expect over $370B in total <a href=\"https://ibb.co/m0sMt0t\">revenues</a> on average, which is also more than $35B ahead of where my targets are pointing, so, I think it’s safe to say I have been pretty conservative &amp; reasonable with the growth expectations for the company.</p>\n\n<p>You are probably wondering, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for GOOGLE?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s start by taking a look at this <a href=\"https://ibb.co/RcJL7DK\">CHART</a>, we can see that Google was trading in an increasingly tighter wedge formation since the September lows. Right now, after smashing the earnings report the company has re-entered overbought territory with an RSI of over 70, which we haven’t seen since the big September sell-off. This breakout from this wedge formation came on the back of massive volumes for the stock, so I believe we can see the overbought conditions push the stock lower in the near-term before eventually going back even higher as I expect with my $2326 prediction for the end of the year.</p>\n\n<p>I also think the $1920 to $1935 range can act as future support after it was a good resistance point for the stock.</p>\n\n<p>But, let’s also take a quick look at what 44 analysts on Wall Street are <a href=\"https://ibb.co/ZLyzp7h\">saying</a>. They are mostly very bullish on the stock with an average price target of $2171 and a high price target of $2610. So, guys, I think the analyst still have some catching up to do with upgrades to the stock after the recent earnings report.</p>\n\n<p>Are you asking yourself, what would I do?</p>\n\n<p>I believe it still has plenty of room to <a href=\"https://ibb.co/cLGT2BX\">grow</a>, so I would start building a position if the stock drops under $2000 and especially buy more if it goes to the previous resistance levels between $1920 and $1935</p>\n\n<p>I also believe that the big % of their shares held by <a href=\"https://ibb.co/rw4kX8w\">institutions</a>, with over 72% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard &amp; Blackrock does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities and increase the support levels power.</p>\n\n<p>So, these are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Google has a terrific future ahead, with their market <a href=\"https://ibb.co/WGNF2dP\">share</a> of engine search worldwide crushing the competition and the hole digital ad spending worldwide <a href=\"https://ibb.co/zFdsN0s\">forecasted</a> to continue to grow and take share of the total ad spending worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>I believe Google will remain one of the best companies in the world while also being a good catch-up play to the other big tech names, as Google has underperformed <a href=\"https://ibb.co/4FDfJZz\">compared</a> to most of the other big names with the exception of Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you everyone for reading🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!
