They also got free money from the fed and the government. Most companies have been consistently beating earnings estimate since covid spread as people were given free money also to buy what they want while tech companies massively benefitted from the lockdowns. Even banks continue to report blow out earnings when most expected them to suffer. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the stock market euphoria that covid crisis caused resulted into companies being able to offer tons of additional shares at high prices to pay off debt or expand, market participants mostly didn&#39;t care and they just all absorbed the dilutions left and right, insiders were also very happy to sell at high prices. IPO and blank check mania also allowed companies to have ridiculously high valuations so they were able to raise large amount of funds.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mudtzp/do_you_guys_think_that_most_corporations_are/","title":"Do you guys think that most corporations are actually loving that this covid crisis happened?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-20T05:34:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-20 05:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mudtzp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mudtzp/do_you_guys_think_that_most_corporations_are/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mudtzp/do_you_guys_think_that_most_corporations_are/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"patay_na_daga","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/patay_na_daga","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"patay_na_daga","score":181,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ほとんどの企業は、今回のコビット・クライシスが起こったことを実は喜んでいると、皆さんは思いますか？","the_new_excerpt":"そういえば、ようやくダウンサイジングの正当な理由ができて、社員を再配置することができた。\n従業員を削減することができました。彼らはまた、連邦政府と政府から無料で資金を得た。\n政府だ。covidが普及して以来、ほとんどの企業が常に業績予想を上回っています。\nコヴィッドが広まってから、ほとんどの企業は常に業績予想を上回っています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你们觉得大多数企业其实是喜欢这次科维德危机的发生吗？","the_new_excerpt":"想来想去，他们终于有了一个缩编的理由，他们\n能够裁员。他们还得到了免费的钱 从联邦和的\n政府。大多数公司的盈利一直在超出预期\n因为covid传播，因为人们被给予免费的钱也买什么... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們覺得大多數企業其實是喜歡這次科維德危機的發生嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"想來想去，他們終於有了一個縮編的理由，他們\n能夠裁員。他們還得到了免費的錢 從聯邦和的\n政府。大多數公司的盈利一直在超出預期\n因爲covid傳播，因爲人們被給予免費的錢也買什麼... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mugjuc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mugjuc/us_house_of_representatives_approves_cannabis/","title":"U.S. House of Representatives approves cannabis banking bill.","date":"April 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"米下院が大麻銀行法案を承認。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"美国众议院批准大麻银行法案。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國衆議院批准大麻銀行法案。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1384199186074112007","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1384199186074112007","title":"150,000 RUSSIAN TROOPS ON UKRAIN BORDER, LARGEST MILITARY BUILD UP TO DATE: EU","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 20, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"15万人のロシア軍がウクライナ国境に駐留、過去最大の軍事力増強：EU","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"15万俄军驻扎在乌克兰边境，这是迄今为止最大的军事力量：欧盟。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"15萬俄軍駐紮在烏克蘭邊境，這是迄今爲止最大的軍事力量：歐盟。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mudtzp","previousId":"RedditPost-mugjuc","nextId":"TweetPost-1384199186074112007","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mudtzp/do_you_guys_think_that_most_corporations_are/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
