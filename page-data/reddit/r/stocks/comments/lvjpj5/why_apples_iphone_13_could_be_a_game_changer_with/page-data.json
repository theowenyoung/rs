Initial Asia supply chain builds for iPhone 13 are in the 100-million-unit range compared to the firm&#39;s initial iPhone 12 reads of 80 million, he added.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;While this number will clearly move around over the coming months, we believe this speaks to an increased confidence with Cook &amp; Co. that this 5G driven product cycle will extend well into 2022 and should also benefit from a post-vaccine consumer &quot;reopening environment,&quot; Ives wrote in the note.</p>\n\n<p>The iPhone 13 will likely have a 1 terabyte storage option, double that of the current highest Pro storage capacity, the analyst said. It will also include a number of enhancements, with Lidar across all iPhone 13 models.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the iPhone 13 could be a &quot;game changer&quot; indicating the supercycle party in Cupertino is going well in 2022.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AAPL Price Action:</strong> At last check, Apple shares were rising 5.22% to $127.59.</p>\n\n<h3>Latest Ratings for AAPL</h3>\n\n<p><strong>DateFirmActionFromTo</strong></p>\n\n<p>Feb 2021RBC Capital Assumes Outperform</p>\n\n<p>Jan 2021DA Davidson Maintains Buy</p>\n\n<p>Jan 2021 Deutsche Bank Maintains Buy</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/03/19914271/why-apples-iphone-13-could-be-a-game-changer-with-1tb-storage-option-lidar\">https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/03/19914271/why-apples-iphone-13-could-be-a-game-changer-with-1tb-storage-option-lidar</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/users/shanthi-rexaline\">Shanthi Rexaline</a> , Benzinga Staff Writer</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lvjpj5/why_apples_iphone_13_could_be_a_game_changer_with/","title":"Why Apple's iPhone 13 Could Be A 'Game Changer' With 1TB Storage Option, Lidar 12-month price target of $175, with the bull-case $225","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T23:52:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 23:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvjpj5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lvjpj5/why_apples_iphone_13_could_be_a_game_changer_with/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lvjpj5/why_apples_iphone_13_could_be_a_game_changer_with/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"folkwoodswest","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/folkwoodswest","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"folkwoodswest","score":73,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么苹果iPhone 13可能成为 \"游戏改变者\"，1TB存储选项，利达12个月目标价175美元，牛市225美元。","the_new_excerpt":"随着苹果公司AAPL 5.08%的发布，启动了iPhone的超级周期。\n[https://benzinga.com/stock/aapl#NASDAQ] iPhone 12\n[https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/11/18468357/how-consumers-are-reacting-to-apples-iphone-12-lineup]\n将可能持续到2022年，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼蘋果iPhone 13可能成爲 \"遊戲改變者\"，1TB存儲選項，利達12個月目標價175美元，牛市225美元。","the_new_excerpt":"隨着蘋果公司AAPL 5.08%的發佈，啓動了iPhone的超級週期。\n[https://benzinga.com/stock/aapl#NASDAQ] iPhone 12\n[https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/11/18468357/how-consumers-are-reacting-to-apples-iphone-12-lineup]\n將可能持續到2022年，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m6o8ek","excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/uber-grants-uk-drivers-worker-status-after-losing-major-labor-battle.html\n\nOn the heels of losing a major labor battle in the United Kingdom, Uber will\nreclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers.\n\nUnder the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers will receive some…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m6o8ek/cnbc_uber_grants_more_than_70000_uk_drivers/","title":"[CNBC] Uber grants more than 70,000 UK drivers worker status after losing major labor battle.","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"中新网】Uber在劳资大战中大败后，授予7万多名英国司机工人身份。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/uber-grants-uk-drivers-worker-status-after-losing-major-labor-battle.html\n\n在英国的一场重大劳资争夺战中失利后，Uber将\n将所有在英国的司机重新归类为工人。\n\n根据新的规定，超过7万名司机将获得一些... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"中新網】Uber在勞資大戰中大敗後，授予7萬多名英國司機工人身份。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/uber-grants-uk-drivers-worker-status-after-losing-major-labor-battle.html\n\n在英國的一場重大勞資爭奪戰中失利後，Uber將\n將所有在英國的司機重新歸類爲工人。\n\n根據新的規定，超過7萬名司機將獲得一些... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m6j0h6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6j0h6/me_100/","title":"Me 100%","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 17, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我100%","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我100%","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lvjpj5","previousId":"RedditPost-m6o8ek","nextId":"RedditPost-m6j0h6","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lvjpj5/why_apples_iphone_13_could_be_a_game_changer_with/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
