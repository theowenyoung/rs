Cyclical, travel and leisure stocks pulled back sharply while mega-cap tech stocks slid even as the 10-year Treasury yield edged lower.  </p>\n\n<p>Despite recent dips, the indexes remain near all-time highs, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) up roughly 10% year-to-date, so it’s not necessarily surprising the market beginning to pull back.  Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial wrote in a note today, &quot;Many of our favorite sentiment gauges are becoming extremely bullish, which could be a near-term contrarian warning. The American Association of Individual Investors Sentiment Survey recently showed bulls outnumber bears by the most since January 2018.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In recent weeks, better-than-expected economic data in consumer spending and unemployment and strong performances by mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) have driven the market higher. On the other hand, growth stocks and more speculative plays have pulled back sharply, extending a terrible run of performance in 2021. After hitting all-time highs near the middle of February, many growth stocks are down 30-50% from those levels. While it’s hard to pinpoint the exact factors why, we think (1) elevated Treasury yields compared to 12 months ago, (2) inflationary fears, (3) profit-taking after an incredible run in 2020, and (4) investor rotation to safer assets are all impacting growth stocks to the downside. </p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, market participants will continue to monitor earnings season to gauge if corporate profits are growing in tandem with the recovering economy. Roughly 9% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 81% beating expectation. At the time of writing, Netflix (NFLX) just reported a sharp miss in new paying subscribers added (+3.98 million vs. +6.29 million expected), causing the stock to plummet 10% in after-hours. This is likely to have negative implications for market performance tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, “My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don’t think it’s just going to go back and say, ‘Okay, everything’s fine. Go right back.’ I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Chat startup Discord Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including Microsoft (MSFT), according to people familiar with the matter, as it resumes interest in a potential initial public offering down the line.</li>\n<li>Senior executives with Alphabet&#39;s Google and Apple will testify on Wednesday about antitrust concerns related to their app stores along with executives of three companies which rely on those online stores, the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee&#39;s antitrust panel said on Monday.</li>\n<li>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning Saturday advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive&#39;s treadmill if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March during a treadmill accident.
