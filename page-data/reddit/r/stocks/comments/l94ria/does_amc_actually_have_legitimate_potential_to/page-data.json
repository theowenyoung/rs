This actually got my interested in the stock market and I&#39;ve done my best to understand the reasons behind why that happened and just try grasp some basic fundamentals.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing AMC being hyped up by the same group of people that hyped GME I placed an order for a bunch at 10 dollars when the pre market was still at 6-8 and then it skyrocketed to a pre market of 20 dollars. I got scared and thoughts I&#39;d miss the bus if I didn&#39;t buy right then and there and so I bought at about 18 and the value instantly tanked. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously AMC is a side show to the main event GME but based off what I&#39;ve been able to find the market seems to be incredibly shorted. I see this site being thrown around a lot <a href=\"https://www.highshortinterest.com\">https://www.highshortinterest.com</a> and again I&#39;m really not sure how credible it is. There are lots of claims that this is the week AMC is gonna sky rocket and as much as I want to believe them I want to know just how credible/likely it is that we could see AMC hit 30/40 or even 50 this week.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the value tanks I suppose I&#39;ve learnt my lesson about buying in to hyped stocks and to do actual legitimate research before hand. AMC&#39;s peaks pre covid were hitting upwards of 30 as well so really this isn&#39;t a complete loss.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l94ria/does_amc_actually_have_legitimate_potential_to/","title":"Does AMC actually have legitimate potential to grow as high as people claim?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-31T08:56:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-31 08:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l94ria","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l94ria/does_amc_actually_have_legitimate_potential_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l94ria/does_amc_actually_have_legitimate_potential_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"deadlyavo1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/deadlyavo1","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"deadlyavo1","score":152,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"AMC真的有人们所说的那么高的合法增长潜力吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我对股市的第一次体验，是对GME的一种扭曲的体验。\n从10-20拍摄到像400在几天内。这实际上得到了我的\n对股市感兴趣，我已经尽了最大努力去了解原因。\n背后的原因，只是尝试掌握一些基本的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMC真的有人們所說的那麼高的合法增長潛力嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我對股市的第一次體驗，是對GME的一種扭曲的體驗。\n從10-20拍攝到像400在幾天內。這實際上得到了我的\n對股市感興趣，我已經盡了最大努力去了解原因。\n背後的原因，只是嘗試掌握一些基本的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lgxx3h","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgxx3h/yolo_am_i_doing_this_right/","title":"Yolo!
