Market participants continue to focus on the Treasury yields, a new coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and additional stimulus from Washington. </p>\n\n<p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete [economic] recovery.” Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell’s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. </p>\n\n<p>Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s\">The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine </a>and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March. </p>\n\n<p>In Washington D.C., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate is scheduled to begin debating the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that the House of Representatives recently passed this week, though he did not specify when a vote would be held. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rocket Mortgage (RKT) soared over 70% today, sending the stock to record highs and continuing a dizzying rally in the last few days. Shares were even halted at one point today. In a note to clients, S3 Analytics said, “RKT’s stock price and short selling activity is reminiscent of another recent high flying meme stock – GameStop Inc (GME). Both stocks saw their share price spike due to high retail buying interest (predominantly due to significant social media activity) and an options based gamma squeeze. Both stocks also had/have relatively high short interest and high stock borrow rates which imply strong short-selling demand and limited stock borrow supply.&quot;</li>\n<li>After posting strong earnings and rising more than 8% after-hours yesterday, Zoom’s (ZM) stock price cratered today, with the stock going from 8% up to more than 9% down in today’s session.</li>\n<li>After posting disappointing earnings, NIO’s stock also cratered today, falling more than 12% in today’s session.</li>\n<li>After the recent controversies, Alibaba (BABA) co-founder Jack MA is now the fourth richest person in China, falling from first place. </li>\n<li>In a memo to employees, Ant Group’s executive chairman Eric Jing said an IPO was still in the cards.</li>\n<li>Vizio Holdings, a maker of smart TVs, has filed for an IPO. The company has sold 82.2 million televisions and 11.8 million sound bars since its founding in 2002, the prospectus said.</li>\n<li>*<strong>Please note current stock prices were written in the morning pre-market and do not reflect intraday volatility.</strong></li>\n<li>C3 AI (AI) target raised by Needham &amp; Co from $193 to $195 at Buy.
