The S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 5% in the month of April, led primarily by mega-cap technology and financial stocks. </p>\n\n<p>Today, the economic data released was very promising. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. </p>\n\n<p>This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP (<a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:%7E:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.\">more info here</a>) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank&#39;s monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. </p>\n\n<p>Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” </p>\n\n<p>Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause &quot;out of an abundance of caution,&quot; the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. </p>\n\n<p>In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&amp;J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.” Despite the setback with JNJ, distribution of the vaccine remains strong in the US, with the CDC reporting more than 3 million doses being distributed per day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Coinbase (COIN) blockbuster direct listing with a valuation of more than $100 billion has so far disappointed, with the stock trading well below its debut price of $381.
