In addition to being the IT backbone, they can offer front-end applications.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Start-ups are the smaller counterparts of the high-tech      giants, entering the car data monetization space from a variety of angles,      such as developing new apps, engineering innovative hardware/interfaces      (e.g., retro-fittable gesture-activated controls)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Retailers and service centers are using car data      analytics to optimize their sales network and get the messages about their      offerings directly to drivers</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Automotive OEMs. In addition to selling connectivity-related options and services (e.g., infotainment,      navigation), OEMs are already becoming active in-car data analytics to better understand how customers use their cars, shape their repair and maintenance choices, and improve the link between dealers and customers      (e.g., allowing for real-time, remote booking of vehicle check-ups).</li>\n<li>Insurers are able to capitalize on car data by offering      usage-based insurance contracts, exploring occasion-related policies</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Big data and Cloud Sources of Income (IVY Income):</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Service providers offer data management services </li>\n<li>Regulators/government institutions are setting the standards regarding the collection and sharing of car data.</li>\n<li>Automotive suppliers are developing the software and      hardware that are forming the infrastructure capable of capturing,      analyzing, and selling car data</li>\n<li>Roadside assistance providers can collect and process      distress calls in real-time from vehicle sensors and automated alerts</li>\n<li>Infrastructure operators, including      billing/toll road operators and recharging/refueling players, are      analyzing car data to optimize the geographic deployment of their      respective services</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Customer willingness to pay for features – as opposed to a preference for free, ad-supported features – varies across use cases and geographies. To make it easier for us to have an early estimate of QNX potential revenues, we need to know their market share geographically too.</p>\n\n<p>Germany (As per 2020 Sales):</p>\n\n<p>QNX Clients: VW + Mercedes + BMW + Audi + Ford + Toyota + Kia= more than 62% of the Auto Market </p>\n\n<p>China (As per 2019 Car sales):</p>\n\n<p>QNX Clients: VW+ Honda + Hyundai + Mercedes + BMW +Kia= 42.7% </p>\n\n<p>USA: </p>\n\n<p>QNX Clients: More than 70% </p>\n\n<p>**New EV Clients of QNX are not included and not projected in any figures </p>\n\n<p>**GM and Porsche signed deals with Android Auto and Apple to be the operating systems of the car despite these cars running with QNX system.
