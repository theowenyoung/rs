The proposals are also intended to boost the still-struggling economy, and by confronting climate change, 10 million clean energy jobs could be created if the proposal is successful.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;If executed strategically, our response to climate change can create more than 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class enjoyed by communities across the country, not just in cities along the coasts,&quot; Biden&#39;s website states. </p>\n\n<p>The climate was also high up on the agenda during the confirmation hearing of Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen on Tuesday. <strong>Yellen told lawmakers that Biden&#39;s infrastructure plan will involve investing in clean technology, renewable energy, promoting electric vehicle usage, and creating jobs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Climate change is a critical problem facing the country, and President-elect Biden is committed to a wide range of policies to address it,&quot; Yellen said at the hearing. &quot;And in the process, making sure that in doing that we create good jobs for American workers.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Yellen also said that Biden is in &quot;full support&quot; of restoring full incentives for electric vehicles, along with ensuring workers have the skills to succeed in the electric vehicle industry.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Democratic lawmakers support federal spending for combating climate change. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said in Yellen&#39;s hearing that he hopes to advance a bill that will prioritize clean energy, clean transportation and energy conservation - efforts that address the &quot;existential threat&quot; of the warming climate.</p>\n\n<p>Given the partisan nature of climate proposals over recent years, whether Biden can carry out costly climate initiatives is uncertain, but Yellen remains clear that it will be a priority, and will benefit the economy through job creation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l0tiop/biden_will_move_to_implement_his_2_trillion/","title":"Biden will move to implement his $2 trillion climate plan on day 1 to bolster the economy and kick off the new administration's fight against climate change","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-19T23:08:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-19 23:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l0tiop","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l0tiop/biden_will_move_to_implement_his_2_trillion/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l0tiop/biden_will_move_to_implement_his_2_trillion/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"MedQ7","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MedQ7","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"MedQ7","score":3480,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"拜登将在第一天就着手实施他的2万亿美元气候计划，以支撑经济，并启动新政府应对气候变化的工作。","the_new_excerpt":"气候变化是当选总统乔-拜登资金议程的重中之重，一旦。\n他在周三上任，新政府希望增加就业岗位。\n经济，同时应对气候变暖。\n\n在他的1.7万亿美元的气候提案中，拜登计划扭转许多。\n唐纳德总统...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"拜登將在第一天就着手實施他的2萬億美元氣候計劃，以支撐經濟，並啓動新政府應對氣候變化的工作。","the_new_excerpt":"氣候變化是當選總統喬-拜登資金議程的重中之重，一旦。\n他在週三上任，新政府希望增加就業崗位。\n經濟，同時應對氣候變暖。\n\n在他的1.7萬億美元的氣候提案中，拜登計劃扭轉許多。\n唐納德總統...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l9culr","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9culr/my_grandfather_told_me_i_would_fail_and_to_call/","title":"My grandfather told me I would fail and to call him in a year.
