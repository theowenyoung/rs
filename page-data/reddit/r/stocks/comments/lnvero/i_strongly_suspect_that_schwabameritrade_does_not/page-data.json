This is a multiple of about 50 times the current price. If the price happens to spike that high (it almost certainly won&#39;t), I&#39;ll get $100,000 per share. They&#39;re comfortable doing this, because they probably actually have the shares. Or they feel like they can get them when it happens.</p>\n\n<p>However, they are only willing to let me put a limit of about $250 per share for GME. This is a multiple of only 5x.</p>\n\n<p>They give errors for any attempt to put limit sells higher than this. Why are they treating GME limit sells differently from Google? I have a cash account. There should be no share lending going on. The broker should not be at risk for ANY limit I put on the sale of my shares.</p>\n\n<p>The only conclusion I have been able to draw from this is: They must not actually have all of our shares and are limiting their losses. Try it with any other stock: LIMITS ARE 50x, and as far as I can tell, have always been until GME.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: In my cash account:</p>\n\n<p>1) TD allows Google (and many other stocks) limit sell orders to be placed at about 50x the price.</p>\n\n<p>2) GME limit sell orders can be placed at only about 5x the price.</p>\n\n<p>What gives?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/","title":"I strongly suspect that Schwab/Ameritrade does not actually have our GME shares.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T09:42:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 09:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lnvero","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Fragsworth","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fragsworth","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Fragsworth","score":527,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1367943344882606086","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1367943344882606086","title":"The markets are closed. \n \n✧ S&amp;P 500 △ 1.95%                   \n✧ Nasdaq △ 1.55%              \n✧ Russell 2K △ 2.11%                   \n✧ Dow Jones △ 1.86% \n \nHave a great weekend, everyone!! https://t.co/abR8M1emdS","date":"March 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"市场休市。\n \n✧ S&amp;P 500 △ 1.95%。                  \n✧ 纳斯达克 △ 1.55%。             \n✧ 罗素2K △ 2.11%。                  \n✧ 道琼斯 △ 1.86%。\n \n祝大家周末愉快！https://t.co/abR8M1emdS","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"市場休市。\n \n✧ S&amp;P 500 △ 1.95%。                  \n✧ 納斯達克 △ 1.55%。             \n✧ 羅素2K △ 2.11%。                  \n✧ 道瓊斯 △ 1.86%。\n \n祝大家週末愉快！https://t.co/abR8M1emdS","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lyjwq8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyjwq8/robinhood_brand_perception_crashes/","title":"Robinhood brand perception crashes","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Robinhood品牌认知度崩溃","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Robinhood品牌認知度崩潰","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lnvero","previousId":"TweetPost-1367943344882606086","nextId":"RedditPost-lyjwq8","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
