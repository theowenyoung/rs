Among those 175 million legacy cars, about 5 dollars per licensing fee, that is the reason why BB stock price was so low in the past years.  </p>\n\n<p>2, But with the blackberry gene of safety, security and mobility, of course with the Iso 26262 and safety highest level, link is following <a href=\"https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications\">https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications</a>,  qnx is embedded in Qualcomm and NVIDIA with long time partnership. So blackberry consolidate ability of the communication and computing, and control the first hand data generated inside the cars.</p>\n\n<p>Some guys don&#39;t believe qnx as OS is working on  nvidia, please Google It. It is official declaration in 2018.

In coming future all carmakers will be a fleet of cars, all cars would be sold at costs and carmakers will survive from the subscription fee from the carowners.
