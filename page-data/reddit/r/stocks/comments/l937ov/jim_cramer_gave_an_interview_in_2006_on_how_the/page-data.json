Regular people have long suspected that they don&#39;t get to play by the &quot;rules&quot; that other players in the market do.  They&#39;re angry, they remember major life changing events like the crash of 2008 and how the people responsible weren&#39;t punished, and now they&#39;re looking to fight back.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/cramer-interview-idUKN2036292620070320\">Reuters Article on the Interview</a></p>\n\n<p>&quot;What&#39;s important when you&#39;re in that hedge fund mode, is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it&#39;s important to create a new view, to create a fiction.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Then you call the (Wall Street) Journal and get the bozo reporter in Research in Motion and you would feed that (rival) Palm&#39;s got a killer it&#39;s going to give away. These are all the things you must do on a day like today, and if you&#39;re not doing it, maybe you shouldn&#39;t be in the game.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>“It might cost me $15 million or $20 million to knock RIM down but it would be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs who are also keying on Research in Motion.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... meaning I needed (a stock) down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who cares about the fundamentals?
