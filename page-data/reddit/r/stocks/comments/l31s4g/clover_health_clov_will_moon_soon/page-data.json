Let me tell you why Clover Health ($CLOV) is going to see a great returns within the coming months!</p>\n\n<p>$CLOV merged with $IPOC (Chamath’s SPA). Chamath’s track record speaks for itself. His investments including SPCE, OPEN, and his other current PIPE investment have all done really well and are quality companies. Since the merger with Clover Health, Chamath upped his stake in the Clover Health and now owns roughly 30%. Not long after, a 13D was filed by Clover’s CEO to up his stake in the company and now owns around 37%. The CEO has a proven track record of building successful healthcare businesses on the services side that he’s sold for billions. Another notable mention is Bill and Hillary Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea. She is on the Board of Directors for Clover and has been a believer in the company for a while now. She recently opted to exercise her shares rather than sell after merging because she’s in it for the long haul.  if there’s one thing we know, it’s that the Clinton family gets their bag. Numerous other executives at Clover and Social Capital have done the same  including Ian Osborne. There’s 70+ institutions holding the stock but other notable “smart money” includes backing from Google and Sequoia Capital. If you don’t know what Sequoia capital is, I encourage you to look up previous companies they’ve invested in. Follow the smart money 💎💎💎</p>\n\n<p>Let’s talk some numbers. Medicare Advantage spending was $270 billion in 2019, and is expected to expand to $590 billion by 2025. As of now $CLOV is only in 34 counties. That doesn’t sound that impressive at first glance. However, just being in 34 counties generated them 507M in revenue. They already said this year they’ll be in 108 counties which will take their revenue to just shy of a billion. There’s 3,000 counties in the US. Being in 108 counties is just 0.03% penetration of the total addressable market.... They’ve already said they want to be in every corner of the country and the cash generated from this IPO will help them expand to get there. Their market share is growing exponentially (9x faster than its closest competitors) and revenues are growing 50%+. Speaking of total addressable market, 10,000 boomers turn 65 a day. That’s an extremely concrete and measurable customer base that can only expand. We now have president Biden who has sworn to revamp Medicare and possibly lower age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 60. If that happens, that’s fucking millions of extra potential customers a month. </p>\n\n<p>Let’s talk a little more about what Clover does. They’ve proven to build Medicare Advantage plans that balance quality and cost. They’re fixated on how they can deliver the lowest cost possible. Any business obsessed with delivering value and cost savings to consumers is always successful. Always. To me this is reinforced through their very impressive partnerships with retail giants in the counties they operate in including: Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Costco. But wait, that’s not all they do. Here’s what makes $CLOV special. Clover is a double edged sword. In addition to their Medicare business, the other side of the business (that can be leveraged in conjunction to their Medicare plans) is called Clover Assistant. This is their proprietary AI focused and data driven software. It allows doctors to leverage historical patient data in order to create more effective treatment plans. This results in lowered costs, fewer visits, and better outcomes for everyone involved. Think of this as Einstein for Salesforce CRM or Watson for IBM. Clover Assistant can be the Einstein for the EHRS (electronic health record systems). This industry is prime for disruption. There are very few tech advancements in the healthcare world from an operations perspective. Keep in mind this side of the business is still in its infancy with only 2000 physicians on it. They plan to ramp exponentially with an upcoming direct contracting model in addition to using proceeds from IPO for further market penetration. </p>\n\n<p>Future catalysts include:</p>\n\n<p>-$20 price target from Bank of America (doesn’t seem to be on web yet but pic from Bloomberg Terminal shared on Twitter) </p>\n\n<p>-they were invited to speak at the prestigious JPM Health Conference on 1/12. Check out the deep dive presentation. Tons of great growth states there. JP Morgan coverage/price target soon?</p>\n\n<p>-they are presenting at the 4th annual Medicare Advantage Leadership Innovations Conference on 1/27 where they mentioned they will reveal their latest currently announced partnership. Could be great PR. </p>\n\n<p>-Biden has laid out themes of what he will discuss in the coming week each day. He will discuss his healthcare plans on 1/28 where he will surely discuss his Medicare plans including his plans to lower the Medicare eligibility age </p>\n\n<p>-future PR from Chamath, Clover, major news outlets, and price targets. There is very little PR on the web about Clover Health currently as a recent IPO. Once that picks up we are going to the moon!</p>\n\n<p>-technicals: there’s been a lot of speculation that the suits have held this stock down to shake out weak hands and load up before the fireworks begin. The stock has been heavily accumulating in a descending wedge. Looks like the short volume is decreasing and when PR starts to come out, shorts will cover, basically making this a mini squeeze out. Chart looks ready. </p>\n\n<p>-float: a lot of the public float has been eaten up with the executives involved increasing their share. 67% is owned between $CLOV CEO Vivek and Chamath alone. According to Yahoo Finance data, there’s only 11M float left of 145M shares outstanding. That’s not too much left for retail to buy especially once there’s more eyeballs on this stock via PTs and PR. That’s getting close to low float levels. Low float + short squeeze = 🚀</p>\n\n<p>This to me seems like a no brainer especially under this new administration. See you all on the moon 🌚 </p>\n\n<p>Position: YOLO averaged up to $14 with entire life savings</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l31s4g/clover_health_clov_will_moon_soon/","title":"Clover Health ($CLOV) will moon soon","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-23T05:59:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-23 05:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l31s4g","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l31s4g/clover_health_clov_will_moon_soon/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l31s4g/clover_health_clov_will_moon_soon/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Ace372","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ace372","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Ace372","score":86,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"三叶草健康（花旗LOV）即将登月。","the_new_excerpt":"好了，听好了伙计们。我知道这个行业不像电动汽车和金融科技那么性感，但是... ...\n这个空间很重要。让我来告诉你，为什么花旗LOV（Clover Health）要去\n在未来的几个月内看到一个巨大的回报!\n\n花旗LOV与国际纸业OC (Chamath's SPA)合并。Chamath的业绩证明了\n本身。他的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"三葉草健康（花旗LOV）即將登月。","the_new_excerpt":"好了，聽好了夥計們。我知道這個行業不像電動汽車和金融科技那麼性感，但是... ...\n這個空間很重要。讓我來告訴你，爲什麼花旗LOV（Clover Health）要去\n在未來的幾個月內看到一個巨大的回報!\n\n花旗LOV與國際紙業OC (Chamath's SPA)合併。Chamath的業績證明了\n本身。他的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lbacc0","excerpt":"Bumble revealed their IPO price range today, $28-$30, which is pretty\naffordable.
