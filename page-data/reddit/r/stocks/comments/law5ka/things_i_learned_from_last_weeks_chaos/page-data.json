I figured I had money i was willing to risk using &lt;5% of my portfolio and I fortunately got in at $94 last Monday.</p>\n\n<p>I was seeing 3-4x gains throughout the week and I definitely got caught up in everyone else’s euphoria at WSB saying to diamond hand it to $1k. Looking back, I should have followed DFV’s footsteps last week and start locking in profits on the way up. While I’ve already learned years ago to not FOMO and buy high, I learned this week that unrealized gains are WORTHLESS and you shouldn’t hold the bag for too long. </p>\n\n<p>I still got out green and it was only &lt;5% of my portfolio. I know some people have it worse by putting in way more than they can afford to lose, but I didn’t realize how emotionally invested I would be and how bummed I would still feel for letting the crazy 3x gains slip away using. Unless the money was life changing, it wasn’t worth the emotional roller coaster IMO. </p>\n\n<p>Lessons I learned:\n-Lock in profits as soon as you start feeling euphoric from the gains</p>\n\n<p>-Don’t let other people influence your decisions </p>\n\n<p>-GET OUT once the hype train gets in</p>\n\n<p>If you guys have any other tips, please let me know!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/law5ka/things_i_learned_from_last_weeks_chaos/","title":"Things I learned from last weeks chaos","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T19:07:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 19:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"law5ka","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/law5ka/things_i_learned_from_last_weeks_chaos/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/law5ka/things_i_learned_from_last_weeks_chaos/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"jabilas","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jabilas","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jabilas","score":209,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我从上周的混乱中学到的东西","the_new_excerpt":"我在过去的4年里一直在做美元成本平均法，我决定给它加点料。\n上周，我跳上了GME的火车。我想我有钱，我愿意\n冒着使用<5%的投资组合的风险，我很幸运地在上周一94美元进入。\n\n我看到整个星期有3-4倍的收益，我绝对...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我從上週的混亂中學到的東西","the_new_excerpt":"我在過去的4年裏一直在做美元成本平均法，我決定給它加點料。\n上週，我跳上了GME的火車。我想我有錢，我願意\n冒着使用<5%的投資組合的風險，我很幸運地在上週一94美元進入。\n\n我看到整個星期有3-4倍的收益，我絕對...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lisez0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lisez0/i_am_shocked_that_paper_handing_is_going_on_in/","title":"I am SHOCKED that paper handing is going on in this sub","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我很震惊，在这个分局里，竟然会有递纸的情况发生。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我很震驚，在這個分局裏，竟然會有遞紙的情況發生。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lizajk","excerpt":"I did some backtesting with the data from the beginning of 1995 to this year,\nand found that if you hold GE from the beginning of 1995 to the end of 1998,\nMSFT from the beginning of 1999 to the end of 2000, then GE from 2001 to 2004,\nXOM 2005 to 2011, AAPL 2012 to 2018, MSFT 2019 to 2020 and switch…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lizajk/only_holding_the_company_with_the_largest_market/","title":"Only holding the company with the largest market cap in the world at the moment seems to beat the S&P 500 index fund by a large margin for the past 25 year.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 13, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"目前只有持有世界上市值最大的公司，似乎在过去的25年里，以较大的优势战胜了标普500指数基金。","the_new_excerpt":"我用1995年初到今年的数据做了一些回测。\n并发现，如果你从1995年开始到1998年年底持有GE。\n从1999年初到2000年底，MSFT，然后从2001年到2004年，GE。\nXOM 2005年至2011年，AAPL 2012年至2018年，MSFT 2019年至2020年，并转...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"目前只有持有世界上市值最大的公司，似乎在過去的25年裏，以較大的優勢戰勝了標普500指數基金。","the_new_excerpt":"我用1995年初到今年的數據做了一些回測。\n並發現，如果你從1995年開始到1998年年底持有GE。\n從1999年初到2000年底，MSFT，然後從2001年到2004年，GE。\nXOM 2005年至2011年，AAPL 2012年至2018年，MSFT 2019年至2020年，並轉...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-law5ka","previousId":"RedditPost-lisez0","nextId":"RedditPost-lizajk","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/law5ka/things_i_learned_from_last_weeks_chaos/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
