But that&#39;s fine, the current price not only reflects the fundamental value, also the short squeeze that is bound to happen. In the short run, the price can definitely go up, but in the long run, option pricing suggests a lower price. Retail that buys high and gets out too late will be having some losses. Only bet with what you can lose. But at this point it&#39;s not only about making a good bet. <strong>It&#39;s (also) about teaching the hedge funds a lesson.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The high short float doesn&#39;t mean that not a single hedge fund has covered its short. Many have probably covered and new shorts have taken their place; leaving the short % of float more or less equal. Shorts that have covered have already eaten their loss, but new shorts are stepping in at higher and higher prices. If the price is going to fall in the long run then they still win. <strong>How to make sure those hedge funds have to eat a loss too?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am no expert in this, but I saw Marc Cuban say interest for borrowing the shares is at 30% per year. Some even mentioned 250%. As long as everybody holds their shares, hedge funds are losing 30%-250% per year on their GameStop investment. Not bad.</p>\n\n<p>By holding, <strong>shareholders have the upper hand</strong> and shorts are losing every single day. <strong>But, there is a risk.</strong> What if more shares were issued?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If GameStop issues new shares to refinance debt it&#39;s not that big of a deal. Due to the high share price, GameStop only has to issue 1-2m (?) shares to refinance all of its outstanding debt.</li>\n<li>GameStop might issue new shares to raise cash and profit from this unique situation. Depending on how much they dilute shares it can be good or bad. Again, with the high share price, they can raise a lot of cash with little extra shares. And if they invest it wisely, it will make the company better. If they issue many shares, it can disrupt the stronghold shareholders have on hedgefunds. That would be bad.</li>\n<li>Current large shareholders might sell their stake. I am sure large shareholders (BlackRock) like to see their competitors lose 30-250% on their investment each year, but I think they do like to realize their sick gains <strong>more</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>To keep the stronghold, you have to prevent GameStop management from issuing many new shares and keep major shareholders on board</strong></p>\n\n<p>GameStop has to become as valuable as the current share price implies, for instance by using the 30-250% interest that hedge funds pay on borrowing shares. If this income stream can somehow be transferred to GameStop or shareholders, instead of brokers, than this may make the current share price real.</p>\n\n<p>I know the dream of the short squeeze is to go to infinity and bankrupting hedge funds. But who is going to pay you if they are bankrupt? If no one sells, they keep their short position and they have to pay the borrow rate that you set (maybe?). Basically you have created the goose with the golden eggs. Make them work for you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In the short run the price can go up, but option prices suggest long term price is lower.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>If that becomes true, hedge funds still win.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>To prevent hedge funds from winning, the long term price must become equal to the current price.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>GameStop may be able to do that by tapping into the borrow rate income stream.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>By never selling, you can create the goose with the golden eggs. You can make hedge funds go broke, but revenge would be even sweeter by making them your work for you.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please destroy this ridiculous idea</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l9iegq/gme_endgame_making_the_shorts_work_for_the_longs/","title":"GME endgame: making the shorts work for the longs","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-31T23:59:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-31 23:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l9iegq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l9iegq/gme_endgame_making_the_shorts_work_for_the_longs/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l9iegq/gme_endgame_making_the_shorts_work_for_the_longs/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"9xD4aPHdEeb","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/9xD4aPHdEeb","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"9xD4aPHdEeb","score":93,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME终结者：让短线为长线服务","the_new_excerpt":"我又看到一个帖子，说这对散户来说，结局会很糟糕\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8yamo/buying_gme_is_not_screwing_wall_street_it_is/]。\n但也许对于GameStop的投资者来说，有一个更美好的结局。\n\n(原本是写给wsb的，但这可能是一个... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME終結者：讓短線爲長線服務","the_new_excerpt":"我又看到一個帖子，說這對散戶來說，結局會很糟糕\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8yamo/buying_gme_is_not_screwing_wall_street_it_is/]。\n但也許對於GameStop的投資者來說，有一個更美好的結局。\n\n(原本是寫給wsb的，但這可能是一個... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lhdjf1","excerpt":"$TM Toyota Motors\n\n**Full disclosure: I own 75k in Toyota calls.
