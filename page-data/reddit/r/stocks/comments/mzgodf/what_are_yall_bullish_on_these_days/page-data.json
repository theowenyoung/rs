I have positions in lam research, amd, Snap, and I want back into intel (sold before earnings because it was getting a bit crazy and easy to see the drop coming.)</p>\n\n<p>AMD I scooped up on a dip and have been happy, I bought some more today and averaged up a tiny bit. I am actually not the biggest fan of their pc parts, but it&#39;s because I&#39;m old school and just prefer intel CPUs and nvidia gpus. But many enthusiasts are actually using AMD these days, and their numbers have been well. They have a PEG of ~1.5 which doesn&#39;t exactly make it great value right now, but I think the stock is undervalued compared to peers. I will hold this and average down if when I get the opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Lam research has a PEG of 1.2 and I expected it to be higher honestly. I bought the stock with the intent to hold for long and average down over time but I haven&#39;t even had that opportunity yet. Wish I bought a bit more to trim, but I think I will stick to my guns and hold it long. </p>\n\n<p>Snaps just a long hold, definitely way overvalued, but I expect to average down at some point. I&#39;m honestly in snapchat because my portfolio has been very boring lately, and I&#39;ve owned the stock before at much lower prices. Their earnings report wasn&#39;t terrible, wasn&#39;t great, but I think as the years go on the company will be able to do well. I&#39;m not really too attached to this play, it&#39;s a small percentage and it&#39;s a bit speculative and not really my style, but for now I&#39;m a happy holder especially since they did breakeven on this earnings.</p>\n\n<p>Intel is a powerhouse and many call it a value trap, I think the markets just waiting for them to stop making mistakes and I think Pat will be able to SLOWLY turn them around. Long hold and I will buy some soon, haven&#39;t gotten back in it yet.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also extremely bullish on oil and energy. Brent has been doing very well and holding for now, and I think that the debt the oil companies has accumulated was actually beneficial because it&#39;s so cheap. Exxon and chevron I love, as well as the pipelines. (I sold all my enbridge early, and may sell some puts to try and get back in at a small discount)</p>\n\n<p>Carbon capture is a tried and true method of reducing emissions, albeit not the best way of going green, but it will be profitable IF Biden can put a price on co2. BP, shell, and exxon all already do this as well as many other companies. Don&#39;t know too much about it but I did some light reading for a couple hours and it&#39;s old stuff been around since the 70s, but it does work and is a realistic next step in reducing emissions. Definitely not a permanent solution but I see it as a necessary stepping stone and there may be money to be made.</p>\n\n<p>Oil is also not going anywhere for at least a decade, probably longer, so I believe these companies are all extremely undervalued even after their run ups. Going forward 2 years I think even when oil prices normalize,  I think the giants will be in a better position overall. </p>\n\n<p>I like GE for their wind turbines as well, although it&#39;s much smaller scale and doesn&#39;t really bring much to stock price. I believe Siemens does this as well, but I do not own siemens. With Biden in office and oil prices getting high, it&#39;s the perfect storm for greener energies.</p>\n\n<p>I went into this earnings season a bit bearish and I still expect it to be rocky, so properly hedging should be on everybodies list as well. But I believe the bull market will be fine over the next year, albeit not completely smooth. Healthcare is a solid industry to invest in during times like these as the big names are quite undervalued. I&#39;m not bullish on healthcare, but it&#39;s a savings account and it&#39;s not volatile when everything else is, so its a defensive play when IV is very low.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mzgodf/what_are_yall_bullish_on_these_days/","title":"What are y'all bullish on these days?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-27T20:48:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-27 20:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mzgodf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mzgodf/what_are_yall_bullish_on_these_days/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mzgodf/what_are_yall_bullish_on_these_days/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"third_legatron","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/third_legatron","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"third_legatron","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"最近、皆さんは何に強気になっていますか？","the_new_excerpt":"私は今、ハイテクにかなり強気で、私のポートフォリオに占める割合はこれまでで最も高い7％以上です。\n私のポートフォリオに占める割合は、これまでで最も高く、7％を超えています。私はラム\nリサーチ、アムド、スナップ、そしてインテルに戻りたいと思っています（決算前に売ったのは\n少しおかしくなってきていて、下落することが容易に予想できたので、決算前に売却しました。)\n\nAMDは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"这些天你们都看好什么？","the_new_excerpt":"实际上，我现在相当看好科技，它在我的投资组合中的比例是有史以来最高的。\n它在我的投资组合中的比例是最高的，超过了7%! 我在Lam\n研究公司、AMD、Snap，我还想回购英特尔（在财报前卖出，因为它变得有点疯狂，很容易看到下跌。\n因为它变得有点疯狂，很容易看到下跌的到来）。)\n\nAMD我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這些天你們都看好什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"實際上，我現在相當看好科技，它在我的投資組合中的比例是有史以來最高的。\n它在我的投資組合中的比例是最高的，超過了7%! 我在Lam\n研究公司、AMD、Snap，我還想回購英特爾（在財報前賣出，因爲它變得有點瘋狂，很容易看到下跌。\n因爲它變得有點瘋狂，很容易看到下跌的到來）。)\n\nAMD我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mzpzzj","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzpzzj/yoled_everything_on_gme_i_believe_the_price_will/","title":"Yoled everything on GME.
