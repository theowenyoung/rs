There’s about 10,750 HAE patients in the U.S. alone.</p>\n\n<p>Let me take a pause to mention that having HAE fucking sucks. People get massive swelling pretty much completely randomly, including in their airway (bad — can’t breathe) or their gut (bad — vomiting, can’t eat). The treatment fucking sucks, which is basically getting C1 inhibitor from donor blood administered IV (or more commonly fresh frozen plasma which contains C1 inhibitors). As you might imagine this is incredibly fucking disruptive to their life.</p>\n\n<p>So given the fresh DD on $BCRX, I thought to myself, “the parts of my brain used for numbers are smooth because I just memorized everything like they said to in medical school, but here’s something I can get real insight into!”</p>\n\n<p>I spoke with a few of my colleagues in Hematology who mentioned that they’ve had tons of patients switch from Haegarda (requires injection) and Cinryze (requires injection) to Orladeyo (just an oral pill). Patients hate self-injecting medications. Many of them are queasy, or you have to get a family member to help you, and it reminds you that you’re chronically sick. We have patients who go to the emergency room over and over again because we can’t convince them to start on new medications. All of these patients have been started on Orladeyo and have since avoided the ER, saving society tons of money.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: $12C 1/21/22 x 500 at an average cost of $4 in the last week (to account for earnings from this year’s Berotralstat sales) -- it&#39;s traded sideways so far.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfrner/dd_biocryst_bcrx_treatment_costs_500k_a_pop_and/","title":"DD: Biocryst ($BCRX) treatment costs $500k a pop and it’s selling like hotcakes","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T03:39:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 03:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfrner","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfrner/dd_biocryst_bcrx_treatment_costs_500k_a_pop_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfrner/dd_biocryst_bcrx_treatment_costs_500k_a_pop_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"HourPath","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HourPath","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"HourPath","score":610,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"DD：生物晶体($BCRX)治疗费用50万一个，而且卖得很火爆。","the_new_excerpt":"简单的总结。\n\n * 我是个医生\n *患者喜欢他们的药物，Berotralstat (Orladeyo)，因为他们不喜欢。\n   需自注\n * Orladeyo一年的费用是50万，而且得到了保险公司的认可。\n * 这意味着，仅此一种药物，BCRX的价值就被低估了10倍--（121美元）。\n   vs0","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DD：生物晶體($BCRX)治療費用50萬一個，而且賣得很火爆。","the_new_excerpt":"簡單的總結。\n\n * 我是個醫生\n *患者喜歡他們的藥物，Berotralstat (Orladeyo)，因爲他們不喜歡。\n   需自注\n * Orladeyo一年的費用是50萬，而且得到了保險公司的認可。\n * 這意味着，僅此一種藥物，BCRX的價值就被低估了10倍--（121美元）。\n   vs0","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lpzmb6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpzmb6/amc_here_we_go/","title":"$AMC here we go 😊🚀","date":"February 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$AMC我们走吧😊🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"$AMC我們走吧😊🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lqabal","excerpt":"I think we all agreed about the moving of the us stock market has great impact\non the crypto market, but how about the opposite?\n\nBefore people don’t think crypto market can influence the stock a lot, but now\nthings are changing.\n\nIf we look back to what happening in the last few weeks or months, we…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lqabal/there_could_be_a_feedback_loop_between_crypto/","title":"There could be a feedback loop between crypto market and the stock market","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 23, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"加密市场和股市之间可能会有一个反馈循环","the_new_excerpt":"我想大家都同意美国股市的走势有很大的影响。\n在加密市场上，但是反过来呢？\n\n以前人们不认为加密市场能对股票产生很大的影响，但现在呢？\n事情正在发生变化。\n\n如果我们回顾一下过去几周或几个月发生的事情，我们... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"加密市場和股市之間可能會有一個反饋循環","the_new_excerpt":"我想大家都同意美國股市的走勢有很大的影響。\n在加密市場上，但是反過來呢？\n\n以前人們不認爲加密市場能對股票產生很大的影響，但現在呢？\n事情正在發生變化。\n\n如果我們回顧一下過去幾周或幾個月發生的事情，我們... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lfrner","previousId":"RedditPost-lpzmb6","nextId":"RedditPost-lqabal","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfrner/dd_biocryst_bcrx_treatment_costs_500k_a_pop_and/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
