Market participants digested a slew of corporate earnings reports from big banks in the US and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell</p>\n\n<p>Earnings kicked off this morning with several banks reporting first-quarter earnings. JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) blew past analyst expectations, driven by lower loan losses, robust trading and investment banking revenue. Expectations for a strong profit rebound have helped financial stocks and the equity markets rally but have also set a high bar for companies to clear. </p>\n\n<p>Wall Street analysts are expecting a surge in corporate profits in tandem with the recovering economy, with the reopening of the economy and a rise in consumer spending set to boost companies’ results. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial said, “We could see upwards of 30% year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. That would be the most we’ve seen since coming out of the financial crisis. Expectations are for about 25% earnings growth in the first quarter. And let’s not forget in the previous two quarters what happened: massive, massive beats.”</p>\n\n<p>Jerome Powell reiterated that a near-term move on interest rates remains unlikely until economic recovery, and particularly the labor market, are able to build up momentum and said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program “well before” raising interest rates. Powell said, “We will taper asset purchases when we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.”</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor the report of March retail sales set to be released tomorrow. March retail sales are expected to be strong, with stimulus checks making their way into the economy and the economy gradually reopening due to effective distribution of the vaccine. Economists expect March retail sales to rise a consensus 6.1%, or 5.3% excluding autos, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a sales decline of 3% in February</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Coinbase debuted in the market today via direct listing. It was a volatile day, with shares opening at $381 before jumping to a high of around $429 before closing at $328.28.</li>\n<li>Ford Motor Co on Wednesday outlined another series of plant shutdowns due to the global semiconductor chip shortage, with five facilities in the United States and one in Turkey affected.</li>\n<li>Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio confirmed its long-awaited partnership with China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation to set up battery swap stations at Sinopec’s gas filling stations. Sinopec is the largest supplier of refined oil products and petrochemicals as well as the second-largest oil and gas producer in China. The company has more than 30,000 gas stations, ranking it second in the world.</li>\n<li>Apple Inc. scheduled an April 20 event dubbed &quot;Spring Loaded,&quot; the tech giant&#39;s latest virtual gathering to unveil new gadgets.
