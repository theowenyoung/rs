Now something like this isn&#39;t really enough to cause a major crash but the real danger is how deep these firms are in the red when their lenders are forced to pay their client&#39;s mistake to GemE shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>If the lenders(usually giant investing firms and banks) somehow don&#39;t have the liquid capital to close out their borrower&#39;s positions, then we&#39;ll see the dominos start falling as they too start liquidating their own stock positions which then causes a even bigger sell off.</p>\n\n<p>But we&#39;re not done just yet. What if GemE reaches such an absurd price that results in the huge institutions and banks to owe more money than their entire networth? This is what happened in 2008 and this is what the elites are scared of.</p>\n\n<p>I seriously see this all playing out and GemE hitting a ludicrous price in the thousands. The government will be forced again to bailout the incompetent and that bailout money will go directly to you, the shareholder. The domino effect on the economy of multiple hedge funds crashing down, liquidating their other stock positions, causing more pressure on the market etc. is very real.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l5tuqc/on_the_trajectory_towards_another_2008_style/","title":"On the trajectory towards another 2008 style recession?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-27T14:57:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-27 14:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l5tuqc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5tuqc/on_the_trajectory_towards_another_2008_style/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5tuqc/on_the_trajectory_towards_another_2008_style/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"tylertime98","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/tylertime98","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"tylertime98","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"在走向另一个2008年式的经济衰退的轨道上？","the_new_excerpt":"2008年的市场崩盘是由于银行家发放了太多的抵押贷款，而这些抵押贷款可能是\n不被支付。\n\n2021年市场崩盘将由银行家向企业放贷杠杆率过高引起。\n谁也无法覆盖。\n\n我们将看到多个对冲基金/机构宣布破产，很。\n很快，这将迫使他们...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在走向另一個2008年式的經濟衰退的軌道上？","the_new_excerpt":"2008年的市場崩盤是由於銀行家發放了太多的抵押貸款，而這些抵押貸款可能是\n不被支付。\n\n2021年市場崩盤將由銀行家向企業放貸槓桿率過高引起。\n誰也無法覆蓋。\n\n我們將看到多個對沖基金/機構宣佈破產，很。\n很快，這將迫使他們...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ldp52a","excerpt":"This isn’t some ideological battleground.
