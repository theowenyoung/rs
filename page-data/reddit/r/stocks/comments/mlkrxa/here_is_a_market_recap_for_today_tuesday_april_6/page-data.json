Market participants are encouraged by better-than-expected economic data and President Biden’s infrastructure plan. </p>\n\n<p>The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It [the jobs report] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”</p>\n\n<p>As the economy continues to recover, analysts have been expediently raising their estimates for companies&#39; first-quarter earnings results, with earnings season beginning in just a couple weeks. According to FactSet, first-quarter <a href=\"https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1\">earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%</a> over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James said, “Not only is the economy doing better, but that&#39;s actually leading to earnings revisions going higher, and that&#39;s taking the market higher. And I don&#39;t think we&#39;re done yet. I think people are going to continue to see the strength of this economy during the summer, and you&#39;re going to see earnings continue to move up significantly throughout this year.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of US states are on track to open vaccine eligibility to all adults before President Biden’s May 1 deadline. An average of more than 3 million individuals are getting vaccinated every day, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As vaccine distribution efforts continue, cyclical and reopening stocks have outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020. We expect this trend to continue moving forward, as more states gradually reopen. </p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged the adoption of a minimum global corporate tax rate during virtual meetings with the World Bank and IMF.</li>\n<li>An index tracking U.S. service sector activity surged to an all-time  high in March, the Institute for Supply Management said Monday</li>\n<li>A U.S. auto industry group on Monday urged the government to help as it warned the global semiconductor shortage could result in 1.28 million fewer vehicles built this year and disrupt production for another six months.</li>\n<li>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded its forecast for global growth this year amid a better-than-expected outlook for the U.S. and other major economies.
