Whilst yes, the game does indeed load at start up, having quest-giving necessary NPC&#39;s disappearing from the game is totally and utterly gamebreaking, potentially forcing players to (at worst) hard-reset their save files. And anyway, it&#39;s a given that consumers expect a working, functioning product from an established dev at $60-80+ a pop.
