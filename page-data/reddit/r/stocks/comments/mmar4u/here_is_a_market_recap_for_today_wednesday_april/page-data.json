The International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth forecast to 6% this year from the 5.5% rise seen previously, largely reflecting the expectation of quick recovery in the U.S. economy. Moreover, JP Morgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the current US economic boom “could easily run into 2023” amid the massive fiscal and monetary policy support provided to people and businesses. </p>\n\n<p>This week, the Federal Open Market Committee have shed light on how monetary policymakers are thinking about the current economic climate. Most important, market participants want to know what conditions would warrant an adjustment of the Fed’s current policy stance and their thoughts on potential inflation. FOMC members noted that the economy was “far from achieving the [FOMC’s] broad-based an inclusive goal of maximum employment” suggesting policymakers are willing to maintain their current accommodative stance for the foreseeable future, barring a sharp and unforeseen upturn in inflation or economic recovery.</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, we are eagerly awaiting first-quarter earnings season in the coming weeks, with the hope that the reports show corporate profits are growing strongly in tandem with strengthening economic conditions. Deutsche Bank Strategist Binky Chadha wrote in a note “Very near term, we expect equities to continue to be well supported by the acceleration in macro growth, and see buying by systematic strategies and buybacks driving a grind higher. But we expect a significant period of consolidation as growth peaks over the next three months.” </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shares of embattled EV-company Nikola (NKLA) sank further after the company said its head of fuel-cell development departed from the company. </li>\n<li>An index tracking U.S. mortgage applications slid for a fifth straight week last week as mortgage rates climbed higher.
