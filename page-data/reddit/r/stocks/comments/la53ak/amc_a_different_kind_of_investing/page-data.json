I grew up going to movie theaters with friends, and I think it holds sentimental value with plenty of you as well. It’s one thing for a company to fail due to bad business, and it&#39;s another for it to fail due to a random, unexpected, unpreventable pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>These last few weeks have taught the retail investor, and everyone, a valuable lesson. It was really only a matter of time until something like this occurred: that the internet would form a substantial community of ongoing communication large enough to eventually take on larger financial institutions. The retail investor has never had this much buying power ever before, and because of the nature of the internet, I see that as being unlikely to change. Thus the stock market has become, and will become, more reflective of a democracy. Middle class individuals, when working together, have the power to make the changes we want to see in the stock market. We can save the companies we want to save.</p>\n\n<p>Now, none of this is to say that fundamentals don&#39;t matter. Fundamentals matter. But, not only do fundamentals affect stock prices, but stock prices (can) affect fundamentals. A projected growth for a corporation can be self fulfilling. An increasing stock price (which has been suppressed by short sellers), can open many new opportunities for AMC and truly be a game changer for their business.</p>\n\n<p>America’s entertainment industry is the largest in the world and an integral piece of our economy. Do we the people want to allow movie theaters to become a thing of the past? I don&#39;t. And with a Democratic Spirit, I will vote with my money for a future I&#39;d like to see.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on this. Of course, this strategy, of creating value vs finding value, is not for every investor. But I think there is a paradigm shift occurring, where there is a new possibility of helping companies we like. Feel free to disagree with any of this, I&#39;d just like to hear your thoughts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/la53ak/amc_a_different_kind_of_investing/","title":"AMC: A Different Kind of Investing","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T20:59:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 20:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"la53ak","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/la53ak/amc_a_different_kind_of_investing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/la53ak/amc_a_different_kind_of_investing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"LongLiveTheCrown","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LongLiveTheCrown","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"LongLiveTheCrown","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"AMC。不同的投资方式","the_new_excerpt":"AMC对我来说有感情价值。我从小到大都是和\n朋友们，我想这对你们很多人也有感情价值。它的\n一家公司因经营不善而倒闭是一回事，而它是另一回事。\n由于随机的、意外的、不可预防的大流行病而失败。\n\n这些...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMC。不同的投資方式","the_new_excerpt":"AMC對我來說有感情價值。我從小到大都是和\n朋友們，我想這對你們很多人也有感情價值。它的\n一家公司因經營不善而倒閉是一回事，而它是另一回事。\n由於隨機的、意外的、不可預防的大流行病而失敗。\n\n這些...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-li6vyf","excerpt":"In 2010 legendary investor and founder of the Baupost Group Seth Klarman\ndescribed in his annual letter 20 lessons from the financial crisis which were\neither never learned or else immediately forgotten by most market participants.\nWith him at the helm the Baupost Group has averaged around 18% and…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/li6vyf/forgotten_lessons_of_2008_that_are_even_more/","title":"Forgotten lessons of 2008 that are even more relevant today","date":"February 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"2008年被遗忘的教训，在今天更有意义","the_new_excerpt":"2010年，传奇投资人、Baupost集团创始人塞斯-克拉曼(Seth Klarman)\n在他的年度信中描述了从金融危机中得到的20个教训，这些教训是\n要么从不学习，要么立即被大多数市场参与者遗忘。\n在他的掌舵下，Baupost集团平均约18%和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2008年被遺忘的教訓，在今天更有意義","the_new_excerpt":"2010年，傳奇投資人、Baupost集團創始人塞斯-克拉曼(Seth Klarman)\n在他的年度信中描述了從金融危機中得到的20個教訓，這些教訓是\n要麼從不學習，要麼立即被大多數市場參與者遺忘。\n在他的掌舵下，Baupost集團平均約18%和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lhwj1y","excerpt":"Most of my life 14-19 up until a couple months ago I would spend a lot of my\nmoney on weed and nicotine.
