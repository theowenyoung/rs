As a way to hopefully reduce my upcoming financial burden, I&#39;ve been learning more about finance and investing and retirement accounts. </p>\n\n<p>I currently have about $2000 in a Roth IRA through Fidelity and want to put that money into some good ETFs. Ideally I&#39;d like to maximize my returns via a mix of high and low risk investments, but based on my understanding, it&#39;s more beneficial for me to go for high risk because I have several decades until retirement. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve selected 14 ETFs that have interested me and now need help deciding which to actually invest in. I understand 14 investments would lower my risk, which is why I want to simplify my portfolio to maybe 5 or more ETFs. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance! </p>\n\n<p>List of ETFs: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/OwwaCvB\">https://imgur.com/a/OwwaCvB</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/loml90/getting_started_with_etfs_how_would_you_allocate/","title":"Getting started with ETFs - how would you allocate $2000 using the following list?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T06:23:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 06:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"loml90","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loml90/getting_started_with_etfs_how_would_you_allocate/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loml90/getting_started_with_etfs_how_would_you_allocate/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"instaxboi","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/instaxboi","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"instaxboi","score":186,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"我今年24岁，再过几个月就要开始上牙科学校了，这意味着我将...\n我毕业后有约40万的债务（美国私立学校，fml）。作为一种方式来\n希望能减轻我即将到来的经济负担，我一直在学习更多的知识。\n理财和投资以及退休账户。\n\n我目前有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"我今年24歲，再過幾個月就要開始上牙科學校了，這意味着我將...\n我畢業後有約40萬的債務（美國私立學校，fml）。作爲一種方式來\n希望能減輕我即將到來的經濟負擔，我一直在學習更多的知識。\n理財和投資以及退休賬戶。\n\n我目前有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lyysbc","excerpt":"The bubble will burst my apes, but with style.\nOnce we squeeze gme to the moon, and the others like AMC, it will be the biggest\nsqueeze of all time and with multiple stonks we like.
