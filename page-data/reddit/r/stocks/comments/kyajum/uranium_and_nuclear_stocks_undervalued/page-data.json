There are currently no safe or clean ways to generate the amount of sustainable energy that nuclear does. Also, as the world population grows, unless there are giant leaps im technology, the only viable way to create enough power will be through a combination of nuclear, solar, wind and water.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Biden’s administration has a $400 billion dollar sustainable energy proposal and it includes nuclear</strong> </p>\n\n<p>This is rare. What’s even more rare is that he’s one of the only presidents to run on a platform <em>supporting advancement in nuclear energy.</em> He is serious about it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>That’s right, there’s a reason EVs mooned last year and will continue to do well for the foreseeable future. It’s the same reason there is potential for it to happen to the nuclear industry:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tdworld.com/utility-business/article/21151832/president-bidens-vision-for-the-power-sector\">https://www.tdworld.com/utility-business/article/21151832/president-bidens-vision-for-the-power-sector</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>”But I’m republican. I can’t agree with Sleepy Joe...”</strong></p>\n\n<p>You’re in luck! This is something so appealing that everyone and their racist grandma can hold hands and sing Kumbaya on. Bipartisan political handoff shows this is an opportunity area that even politicians can agree to. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trump-boost-to-nuclear-power-to-live-on-in-biden-administration%3f_amp=true\">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trump-boost-to-nuclear-power-to-live-on-in-biden-administration%3f_amp=true</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Even Nuclear industry folks seem highly positive in their world which has been fear mongered and neglected for decades:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Things we&#39;ve seen out of the Biden campaign and the transition team are very promising for a continuation and even acceleration of programs and policies that will support nuclear energy,&quot; said John Kotek, policy development vice president for the Nuclear Energy Institute</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063719675\">https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063719675</a></p>\n\n<p>Make your own decision.
