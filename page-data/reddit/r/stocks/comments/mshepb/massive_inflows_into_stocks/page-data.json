More money poured into the market during the last five months than in the last twelve years.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/more-money-poured-into-stocks-past-5-months-than-over-last-12-years-bofa-2021-04-09/\">https://www.reuters.com/business/more-money-poured-into-stocks-past-5-months-than-over-last-12-years-bofa-2021-04-09/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Investors  have pumped more money into equities over the past five months than in  the last 12 years, BofA&#39;s weekly flow figures showed on Friday, as  ultra-easy monetary policies and unprecedented stimulus has sparked a  secular shift into stocks.  </p>\n\n<p>BofA  said $576 billion had gone into equity funds in the past five months,  beating the combined $452 billion inflows seen in the last 12 years,  </p>\n\n<p>Based  on clients&#39; asset allocations, Bofa said a record 63.6% of the money  was invested in stocks, 18.5% in debt and 11.6% in cash.  </p>\n\n<p>The  exuberance has however slowed in recent weeks, with investors pouring  $22.7 billion into cash during the week to Wednesday, on top of the  nearly $100 billion committed in the last two weeks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How to play this?  I have no idea.  I tend to believe the market will continue melting up as we see spectacular earnings over the next two quarters, and will probably continue on through the holiday season.  But that unusual amount of inflows underlines the current mania.</p>\n\n<p>Usually I don&#39;t put stops on positions that are bought as long term investments rather than speculative plays, but I am rethinking that.  Stops saved my ass on the S PACs and green stocks/ETFs I had earlier this year.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mshepb/massive_inflows_into_stocks/","title":"Massive Inflows into Stocks","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-17T18:15:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-17 18:15","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mshepb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mshepb/massive_inflows_into_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mshepb/massive_inflows_into_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TrioxinTwoFortyFive","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TrioxinTwoFortyFive","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"TrioxinTwoFortyFive","score":40,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"株式に大量の資金が流入","the_new_excerpt":"これは興味深い。この5ヶ月間に市場に投入された資金は、過去12年間で最も多い。\n過去12年間で最も多くの資金が市場に投入された。\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/more-money-poured-into-stocks-past-5-months-than-over-last-12-years-bofa-2021-04-09/\n\n> 投資家は過去12年間でより多くの資金を株式に注ぎ込んだ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"大量资金流入股票","the_new_excerpt":"这很有意思。在过去的5年里，更多的资金涌入市场。\n月比过去12年。\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/more-money-poured-into-stocks-past-5-months-than-over-last-12-years-bofa-2021-04-09/\n\n> 投资者将更多的资金注入股票，在过去的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"大量資金流入股票","the_new_excerpt":"這很有意思。在過去的5年裏，更多的資金湧入市場。\n月比過去12年。\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/more-money-poured-into-stocks-past-5-months-than-over-last-12-years-bofa-2021-04-09/\n\n> 投資者將更多的資金注入股票，在過去的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1383468130991689729","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1383468130991689729","title":"RT @CNBC: There’s a single New Jersey deli doing $35,000 in sales valued at $100 million in the stock market https://t.co/aUc1AuyMcB","date":"April 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"RT @CNBC: 株式市場で1億ドルの価値がある売上を35,000ドルで行っているニュージャージー州のデリが1件あります https://t.co/aUc1AuyMcB","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"株式市場で1億ドルの価値がある売上を35,000ドルでやっているニュージャージーのデリが1軒ある https://t.co/aUc1AuyMcB"},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @CNBC。新泽西州有一家熟食店销售额为3.5万美元，在股市上估值1亿美元https://t.co/aUc1AuyMcB。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"有一家新泽西州的熟食店，销售额做到了3.5万美元，在股市上估值1亿美元，https://t.co/aUc1AuyMcB。"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @CNBC。新澤西州有一家熟食店銷售額爲3.5萬美元，在股市上估值1億美元https://t.co/aUc1AuyMcB。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"有一家新澤西州的熟食店，銷售額做到了3.5萬美元，在股市上估值1億美元，https://t.co/aUc1AuyMcB。"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1383488430013771778","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1383488430013771778","title":"RT @ClayTravis: Bill Maher went off on covid fear porn and the liberal embrace of it last night.
