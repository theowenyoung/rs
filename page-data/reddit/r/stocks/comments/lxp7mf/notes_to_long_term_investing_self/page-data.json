At some points, I was up big in my portfolio, but greed put me back at loss. And at some points, I was down big in my portfolio, but fear kept me at that loss. I&#39;d like to say that over the year, I&#39;ve grown in understanding what works for me and how I plan to switch things up, but I&#39;m still relatively new, and as always, there&#39;s room for improvement. Anyways, here&#39;s the main set of notes I&#39;ve set for myself:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Be prepared for a market correction. Never ever dump your entire cash into the market all at once. Generally, I like to keep around 6 months worth of emergency and dump into the market consistently every 2 weeks. Now with the constant dips, I&#39;m buying a bit more aggressively, but that&#39;s also possible because I had a stash saved for this moment. At the end of the day, you don&#39;t want to be the dude that sees the dip but can&#39;t buy anything and just has to hold. Sure, they&#39;ll probably end up in the green in the long run, but they&#39;ll also experience pain knowing the market presents a great opportunity that they can&#39;t buy into.</li>\n<li>As the market corrects, incrementally dump some money into it. Don&#39;t put everything into the market in one shot. Nobody knows fundamentally how long the correction is. Hell, last week when things started to go back up, I made the silly mistake of thinking the market was done correcting for the most part and dumped money that I was planning on saving for this week, but of course it dipped back. Thankfully, I have extra cash to buy in this week as well. But, please do understand that the market never goes up or down in a straight line curve. It zigzags its way across. One day it&#39;s up, another day it&#39;s down, and sometimes it&#39;s more from either side.</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t listen to fools on the Internet. People that tell you that the stock market is going to completely plummet to ground zero and never recover. Treat these people as ignorant bots that are programmatically regurgitating info that has no substantiation. If you look back in history, rarely ever did the market plummet heavily, and even in all situations in which it did, it went back right up over the years.</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t try to switch back and forth between stocks as they fluctuate. I&#39;m guilty of this, but I&#39;ve made it a deal with myself to stop this behavior because (1) it&#39;ll probably screw up your taxes and (2) you&#39;ll probably end up losing more than winning because the reality of the matter is that you can&#39;t time the market. The market is irrational, and just when you think you&#39;ve understood it, it can backstab you and put you in tough financial situations.</li>\n<li>Stop looking at the prices. It&#39;ll only hurt you more by making you panic and pushing you towards irrational decisions. Hell, in one of my accounts, I had a position in one stock at $36.00 average for a heavy amount of shares, and the market dipped to $27.00 last week. Had I opened the account then, I sure as hell would have been tempted to cut my losses, but I didn&#39;t open my account, and just as it recovered earlier this week at $38-39, I was able to get out in profit. Big difference, see what I mean?</li>\n<li>Understand the value and potential of companies whose stocks you&#39;re investing in. As a company&#39;s stock bleeds, it only comforts you knowing that the sell-off is temporary and that because the company will do great things in the future, the price should go back up. However, if you&#39;re blindly riding the hype, then when stocks dip, you&#39;re more likely to selling at a loss than re-evaluating your purpose in purchasing that stock and whether or not it will recover. See <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/\">r/Nio</a> and you&#39;ll see both types of people. Some know the true value and are holding on while others who jumped in based on hype are panicking big time. To be able to sleep well at night and not worry so much, you need to understand the reason you invest money in such companies.</li>\n<li>Diversify. I personally can&#39;t do this one so well because there&#39;s a lot of religious restrictions on what I can buy versus what I can&#39;t. But for the normal person, they can really buy into any stock that they&#39;d like to so long as they have the financial ability to do so. With that said, try to invest in multiple sectors such that if one goes down, others may potentially rise and make your losses look less painful.</li>\n<li>Evaluate the situation we&#39;re in. Taxes, inflation, bond yields, etc. What do these mean to the market? Which stocks will likely drop versus which will slowly go upward? Sure, you can&#39;t be 100% correct on these decisions, but they should help guide towards more good decisions than bad over time.</li>\n<li>Lastly, in the famous words of Warren Buffet, &quot;We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.&quot; Now, as the market bleeds and people are being fearful, you need to be greedy and invest more. As I said in points (1) and (2) though, don&#39;t quickly dump all your money into the market. Just incrementally dollar cost average and then enjoy the ride upward once the market recovers.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That being said, I wish you all the best of tendies. If you have other advice, feel free to dump it in this thread for others to see.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lxp7mf/notes_to_long_term_investing_self/","title":"Notes to Long Term Investing Self","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-04T19:22:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-04 19:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lxp7mf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lxp7mf/notes_to_long_term_investing_self/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lxp7mf/notes_to_long_term_investing_self/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"kids_eat_drugs","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/kids_eat_drugs","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"kids_eat_drugs","score":186,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"长期投资自我注意事项","the_new_excerpt":"我已经在市场上呆了一年多了，我已经做了一些糟糕的。\n但最近，我决定只吃一颗镇定剂，不再尝试。\n赚快钱，而把精力放在长远的计划上。在某些\n点，我在我的投资组合中涨幅很大，但贪婪让我回到...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"長期投資自我注意事項","the_new_excerpt":"我已經在市場上呆了一年多了，我已經做了一些糟糕的。\n但最近，我決定只吃一顆鎮定劑，不再嘗試。\n賺快錢，而把精力放在長遠的計劃上。在某些\n點，我在我的投資組合中漲幅很大，但貪婪讓我回到...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m8kveb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8kveb/its_nearly_time_apes_gme/","title":"It's nearly time apes (GME)","date":"March 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"几乎是时候猿（GME）了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"幾乎是時候猿（GME）了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m8r2eb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8r2eb/latitude_3034_n_longitude_3640_w_is_officially/","title":"Latitude 30°-34° N Longitude 36°-40° W is officially reserved for GameStop on the Moon.
