Started this year halfway through January. Not panicking right now, just wondering why and how this happens. Last week we saw the same thing happen where Thursday and Friday were mostly red. How does this happen and why are some days massively green, while others are massively red like last week, yesterday and if I have to believe the pre market, today as well. Is it big funds all selling at once?</p>\n\n<p>To add to this question, how often in general does this happen? I understand 2020 and 2021 so far have been insane and abnormal in terms of investing but are these red days something that has always happened on a regular basis?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Some of you seem to not understand what I&#39;m asking here. I&#39;m not asking why stocks go down in value. I realize that&#39;s because people are selling more then buying.
