The company has had no bad news. The stock has a price target of $54. XPENG stock has been hammered down lately due to the lock up period which expires tomorrow. Earnings is on 8 March. $38 seems like an excellent buying opportunity to me. I’ll be adding shares tomorrow near market close. Looks like an easy 10-20% gain in a matter of days/weeks.</p>\n\n<p>LI also looks like a great buy. Quarterly revenue has been seeing consistent growth and earnings is finally reaching break even. Li has also invested a lot of their assets back into the company and their total assets has seen a healthy growth within the last year. </p>\n\n<p>These 2 seemed bound for a pullback after their highs in November but now it seems they are oversold. Are these on anyone else’s watch list ? Anything I should be weary of?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lq1j24/xpeng_set_to_run/","title":"XPENG set to run?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T06:55:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 06:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lq1j24","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lq1j24/xpeng_set_to_run/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lq1j24/xpeng_set_to_run/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"theepicone111","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theepicone111","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"theepicone111","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"XPENG设置运行？","the_new_excerpt":"XPENG在11月24日陡然上涨后，最高见74.49美元。自那时起\n现在回落到38美元--跌幅达50%。该公司没有坏消息。该\nXPENG的目标股价为54美元。\n到明天到期的锁定期。盈利是在8...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"XPENG設置運行？","the_new_excerpt":"XPENG在11月24日陡然上漲後，最高見74.49美元。自那時起\n現在回落到38美元--跌幅達50%。該公司沒有壞消息。該\nXPENG的目標股價爲54美元。\n到明天到期的鎖定期。盈利是在8...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m0haeh","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0haeh/leeeeaving_on_a_rocket_ship/","title":"Leeeeaving on a rocket ship","date":"March 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"在火箭飞船上航行","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"在火箭飛船上航行","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m0ohdg","excerpt":"I’ve been seeing tech taking a massive dump the last couple of weeks, and as\nit’s been dumping I’ve been spending about 1k in there every time it hit a new\nlow, but I’m not exactly sure why it’s happening.\n\nI can perfectly afford to keep buying the dip since I was holding a bit of cash\nin reserve,…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m0ohdg/whats_the_reason_that_tech_is_just_taking_a/","title":"What’s the reason that Tech is just taking a massive dump the last couple of weeks?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 08, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"是什么原因让科技公司在最近几周就出现了大规模的抛售？","the_new_excerpt":"过去几周，我一直看到科技界大肆抛售，而作为\n它一直在倾销，我已经花了约1千在那里 每次它击中一个新的。\n低，但我不太清楚为什么会这样。\n\n我完全有能力继续买入跌停板，因为我持有一点现金。\n储备，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"是什麼原因讓科技公司在最近幾周就出現了大規模的拋售？","the_new_excerpt":"過去幾周，我一直看到科技界大肆拋售，而作爲\n它一直在傾銷，我已經花了約1千在那裏 每次它擊中一個新的。\n低，但我不太清楚爲什麼會這樣。\n\n我完全有能力繼續買入跌停板，因爲我持有一點現金。\n儲備，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lq1j24","previousId":"RedditPost-m0haeh","nextId":"RedditPost-m0ohdg","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lq1j24/xpeng_set_to_run/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
