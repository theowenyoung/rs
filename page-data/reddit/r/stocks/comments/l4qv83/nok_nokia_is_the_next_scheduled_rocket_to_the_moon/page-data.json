Furthermore NOK&#39;s short term assets (€17.4B) also exceed its <strong>long</strong> term liabilities (€12.2B). Their debt to equity ratio (37.9%) is considered satisfactory. Some may be concerned by the fact that NOK&#39;s debt to equity ratio has increased from 30.1% to 37.9% over the past 5 years. However NOK&#39;s debt is well covered by operating cash flow (42.8%) so I&#39;m not stressing and neither should you.</p>\n\n<p>NOKIA&#39;s board of directors are considered experienced (3.7 years average tenure). This gives me hope that they oversea successful management of a relatively new leadership team (1.4 years average tenure).</p>\n\n<p>As always do your own DD but I do believe this is a good stock to get before it blows like every other  hype stock so buy now and settle in for a trip.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l4qv83/nok_nokia_is_the_next_scheduled_rocket_to_the_moon/","title":"NOK (Nokia) is the next scheduled rocket to the moon.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-25T18:35:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-25 18:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l4qv83","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l4qv83/nok_nokia_is_the_next_scheduled_rocket_to_the_moon/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l4qv83/nok_nokia_is_the_next_scheduled_rocket_to_the_moon/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"the_lost_investor","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_lost_investor","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"the_lost_investor","score":538,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"NOK（诺基亚）是下一个预定登月的火箭。","the_new_excerpt":"诺基亚不只是卖低劣的手机和低劣的软件了，他们已经。\n拓展到5G基础设施市场，而据研究机构\nMarketsandMarkets，它应该以67%的年复合增长率增长，到2027年达到478亿美元。\n亿美元，到2027年。\n\n该公司的财务健康状况是一个大...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"NOK（諾基亞）是下一個預定登月的火箭。","the_new_excerpt":"諾基亞不只是賣低劣的手機和低劣的軟件了，他們已經。\n拓展到5G基礎設施市場，而據研究機構\nMarketsandMarkets，它應該以67%的年複合增長率增長，到2027年達到478億美元。\n億美元，到2027年。\n\n該公司的財務健康狀況是一個大...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lckvn5","excerpt":"> I am making this first step and investing my money for the first time,\n> considering I'm coming from a very underprivileged background. - Anon Redditor\n\nI was lurking around /rstocks and found this particular sentence, which gave me\na feeling of an epiphany (\"enlightenment\") or however you call…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lckvn5/keep_them_poor_most_of_us_are_financially/","title":"Keep them poor - Most of us are financially illiterate?","date":"February 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"让他们保持贫穷--我们大多数人都是经济文盲？","the_new_excerpt":"> 我迈出了这第一步，第一次投资理财。\n>考虑到我是出身于非常贫困的家庭。- Anon Redditor\n\n我在/rstocks附近闲逛，发现了这个特别的句子，它给我带来了\n醍醐灌顶之感","locale":"zh"},{"title":"讓他們保持貧窮--我們大多數人都是經濟文盲？","the_new_excerpt":"> 我邁出了這第一步，第一次投資理財。\n>考慮到我是出身於非常貧困的家庭。- Anon Redditor\n\n我在/rstocks附近閒逛，發現了這個特別的句子，它給我帶來了\n醍醐灌頂之感","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lcuh78","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcuh78/they_say_history_repeats_itself/","title":"They say history repeats itself","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"有人说历史会重演","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"有人說歷史會重演","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l4qv83","previousId":"RedditPost-lckvn5","nextId":"RedditPost-lcuh78","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l4qv83/nok_nokia_is_the_next_scheduled_rocket_to_the_moon/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
