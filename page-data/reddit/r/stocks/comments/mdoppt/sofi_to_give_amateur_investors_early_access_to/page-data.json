Retail traders don’t have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.</p>\n\n<p>“Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn’t have before,” SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. “It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.</p>\n\n<p>SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It’s common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don’t typically offer them to the everyday investor. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/sofi-to-give-amateur-investors-early-access-to-ipos-in-break-from-wall-street-tradition-.html\">Source</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mdoppt/sofi_to_give_amateur_investors_early_access_to/","title":"SoFi to give amateur investors early access to IPOs in break from Wall Street tradition","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-26T16:09:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-26 16:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mdoppt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mdoppt/sofi_to_give_amateur_investors_early_access_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mdoppt/sofi_to_give_amateur_investors_early_access_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"kayaarr","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/kayaarr","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"kayaarr","score":193,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"SoFi打破华尔街传统，让业余投资者提前进入IPO市场","the_new_excerpt":"在线金融初创公司SoFi（$IPOE）正在降低淘客门槛\n投资者在公司上市时购买其股票。\n\n这些IPO股票历史上一直是为华尔街的\n机构投资者或高净值个人。散户交易者没有\n买进的方式...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"SoFi打破華爾街傳統，讓業餘投資者提前進入IPO市場","the_new_excerpt":"在線金融初創公司SoFi（$IPOE）正在降低淘客門檻\n投資者在公司上市時購買其股票。\n\n這些IPO股票歷史上一直是爲華爾街的\n機構投資者或高淨值個人。散戶交易者沒有\n買進的方式...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1384931076259385351","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1384931076259385351","title":"The stock market is crashing https://t.co/JL4un3F0uk","date":"April 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"株式市場が暴落している https://t.co/JL4un3F0uk","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"股市正在崩溃 https://t.co/JL4un3F0uk","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"股市正在崩潰 https://t.co/JL4un3F0uk","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mvuaei","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mvuaei/what_would_you_say_you_do_here/","title":"What would you say you do here?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 22, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ここで何をすると言うのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"你会说你在这里做什么？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你會說你在這裏做什麼？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mdoppt","previousId":"TweetPost-1384931076259385351","nextId":"RedditPost-mvuaei","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mdoppt/sofi_to_give_amateur_investors_early_access_to/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
