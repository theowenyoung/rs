Then I found this information a few hours ago, and it has me worried for the people indefinitely holding, with the expectation of a squeeze coming soon. I&#39;m new to the stock market but have learned a bit in the last week. Am I reading this wrong, or have the percentage of shorted shares dropped to 49.21%?</p>\n\n<p>If the squeeze already happened last friday, how is lying about it or hiding this information to keep people buying/holding GME stock, to increase personal profits, ANY different then the bullshit that Hedge Funds do? That is active manipulation and deception for personal gain, not an altruistic attempt to &#39;take down Goliath&#39;, which is why many people (myself included) supported/support the GME/AMC fight.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Even ASKING for people to explain this information to me has resulted in mass downvotes, ZERO direct responses explaining why I am wrong, and a post I made about it on WSB, was deleted within 30 seconds by mods. No explanation was provided for the quick deletion, and after asking why it was deleted, I was ignored. (edit - AND Shadowbanned, as I recently just noticed.)</p>\n\n<p>Is this a &quot;David vs. Goliath&quot; type of fight, or essentially a Ponzi scheme for people who invested early and/or with large funds?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Am I crazy/wrong, or is ignorance and greed now fueling this &#39;movement&#39;? <strong><em>ANY</em></strong> explanation is greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>edit- Shoutout to the mods here for reinstating this post after it was initially removed. The mods over at WSB shadowbanned me after I asked the same question.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/laahda/serious_question_did_the_gme_squeeze_already/","title":"Serious question, did the GME squeeze already happen?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T20:34:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 20:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"laahda","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/laahda/serious_question_did_the_gme_squeeze_already/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/laahda/serious_question_did_the_gme_squeeze_already/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Tazwhitelol","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tazwhitelol","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Tazwhitelol","score":837,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"严重的问题是，金交所的挤压已经发生了吗？","the_new_excerpt":"https://i.imgur.com/6BGahUN.jpg\n\n从我知道WSB对抗对冲基金开始，我就一直支持WSB。\n大约一个星期前。然后，我在几个小时前发现了这个信息，它让我。\n忧心忡忡的人无限期地持有，与期望的挤压。\n即将到来。我是新来的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"嚴重的問題是，金交所的擠壓已經發生了嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"https://i.imgur.com/6BGahUN.jpg\n\n從我知道WSB對抗對沖基金開始，我就一直支持WSB。\n大約一個星期前。然後，我在幾個小時前發現了這個信息，它讓我。\n憂心忡忡的人無限期地持有，與期望的擠壓。\n即將到來。我是新來的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-li2g4g","excerpt":"Source\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/roblox-says-revenue-was-higher-than-reported-pushes-listing-to-march.html]\n\nBasically they're trying to milk as much money out of this listing as possible.\nI mean they deserve it with revenues of $613.9m.\n\nBut it reminds me of Zynga and their fallout with…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/li2g4g/roblox_says_revenue_was_higher_than_previously/","title":"Roblox says revenue was higher than previously reported and pushes direct listing to March","date":"February 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Roblox称营收高于此前报告，并将直接上市时间推至3月。","the_new_excerpt":"资料来源\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/roblox-says-revenue-was-higher-than-reported-pushes-listing-to-march.html]\n\n基本上他们是想从这次上市中榨取尽可能多的钱。\n我的意思是，他们的收入为6.139亿美元，理应如此。\n\n但这让我想起了Zynga和他们的后遗症... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Roblox稱營收高於此前報告，並將直接上市時間推至3月。","the_new_excerpt":"資料來源\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/roblox-says-revenue-was-higher-than-reported-pushes-listing-to-march.html]\n\n基本上他們是想從這次上市中榨取儘可能多的錢。\n我的意思是，他們的收入爲6.139億美元，理應如此。\n\n但這讓我想起了Zynga和他們的後遺症... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lhzl35","excerpt":"The first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in North America has been given the\ngo-ahead by Canada’s financial regulator.\n\nAccording to a decision document on Thursday, the receipt of approval from the\nOntario Securities Commission was filed under a Multilateral Instrument passport\nsystem in…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhzl35/first_north_american_publicly_traded_bitcoin_etf/","title":"First North American Publicly traded Bitcoin ETF Approved by Canadian Securities Regulator","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 12, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"首只北美公开交易的比特币ETF获加拿大证券监管机构批准。","the_new_excerpt":"北美首只比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）已获。\n获得加拿大金融监管机构的批准。\n\n据周四的一份决定文件显示，收到加拿大金融监管机构的批准后，加拿大金融监管机构将对该\n安大略省证券委员会是根据多边文书护照提交的。\n系统在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"首隻北美公開交易的比特幣ETF獲加拿大證券監管機構批准。","the_new_excerpt":"北美首隻比特幣交易所交易基金（ETF）已獲。\n獲得加拿大金融監管機構的批准。\n\n據週四的一份決定文件顯示，收到加拿大金融監管機構的批准後，加拿大金融監管機構將對該\n安大略省證券委員會是根據多邊文書護照提交的。\n系統在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-laahda","previousId":"RedditPost-li2g4g","nextId":"RedditPost-lhzl35","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/laahda/serious_question_did_the_gme_squeeze_already/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
