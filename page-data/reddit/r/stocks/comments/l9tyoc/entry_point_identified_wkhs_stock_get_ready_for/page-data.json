Workhorse ($WKHS) has been in the ranks for months now after a MASSIVE explosion in June of 2020 due to a potential &quot;speculation&quot; of obtaining the new 8.3 Billion (~20 Billion over next 10 years in maintenance and infrastructure) United States Postal Service Next Generation Delivery Vehicle Contract (NGDV). They&#39;ve been in the biding process competing with various other companies since 2015 and it&#39;s finally down to the wire with 3 competitors left in the NGDV bid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Oshkosh/Ford</strong> - Who&#39;ve submitted an Internal Combustion Engine vehicle and have a history of federal contracts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Karsan Motors</strong> - A Plug-In Hybrid vehicle owned by a Turkish company.</p>\n\n<p>AND...... <strong>Workhorse</strong> - <em>The ONLY fully electric, American owned vehicle left in the contract.</em></p>\n\n<p>In 2019, Workhorse and Lordstown Motors bought the 6.2 mil square foot GM manufacturing facility in Lordstown, Ohio. Although, its primarily used today for Lordstown Motors, the CEO has been on record saying it will lend WKHS whatever facilities necessary to help them fulfil the USPS contract (Lordstown Motors split off from Workhorse and the CEO&#39;s are partners). And <strong>with the recent news form Biden saying the federal fleet will be replaced with fully electric, Made in America vehicles, this is more than in the bag.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Cathie Woods of Ark invest saw this opportunity back in June and has been loading up. At the time of this post WKHS sits in ARK-Q&#39;s 17th position.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ark-funds.com/arkq\">https://ark-funds.com/arkq</a></p>\n\n<p><em>This,</em> combined with the fact that WKHS has a LARGE amount of <strong>short interest</strong> for a stock going to the moon, sitting at 30 mil short shares out of its 112 mil. <strong>It was even blocked from trading on Friday 29 January, 2021 when they were blocking other short interest stocks to prevent people from moving funds from GME to WKHS. As of right now, It&#39;s tradable and at a great entry point for the contract award date before 31 March.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/WKHS/short-interest/\">https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/WKHS/short-interest/</a></p>\n\n<p>Additionally, it has some <strong>INSANE options activity</strong> around the final dates the contract can be awarded. With <strong>25,789 Open interest in the $45 Call Options expiring 16 April, 2021.</strong> For comparison SPY February 12 $385 Calls only have 2,256 open interest as of the time of this post.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WKHS/options?p=WKHS&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;date=1618531200\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WKHS/options?p=WKHS&amp;amp;amp;amp;date=1618531200</a></p>\n\n<p>WKHS currently sits at a <strong>4.1 Billion</strong> market cap, now it&#39;s true there&#39;s a good amount of the contract priced in already, but not the short interest squeeze that could happen as a result of the news. When WKHS gets awarded the contract, were looking at at least <strong>8.1 Billion</strong> Market Cap, which, correlating that into the share price sets a <strong>Price Target of around</strong> <strong>~$80 - $90</strong> a share. And that&#39;s not even adding in the recent Price Motors Co. order of over 6,000 vehicles.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/workhorse-big-vehicle-purchase-order-020336230.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/workhorse-big-vehicle-purchase-order-020336230.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Buckle up and lets all go to moon together.</p>\n\n<p>*This is not financial advice, invest at your own risk. <em>If they do not get the contract</em> expect a dip.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Target</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>~$80-90</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>WKHS $45c Apr 16</em></p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I had to post this here cause everything on wall street bets that’s not about GME gets deleted.
