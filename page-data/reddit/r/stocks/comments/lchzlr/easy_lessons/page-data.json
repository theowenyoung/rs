It&#39;s put me in a tough investing situation because I&#39;m a bit of a junkie and I like to get into stocks after DD, but have not had the cash to do so. Unfortunately that&#39;s led to me selling portions of my winners for profits to try and make profits elsewhere, and though I&#39;ve maintained good gains and been able to diversify it seems that the stocks I sell always out preform the stocks I buy, at least so far. In any case I guess what I&#39;m saying is I&#39;ve learned to be patient, utilize your watch lists and only sell winners if you believe they&#39;ve capped out, not so you can free up funds to chase other winners. Good luck everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lchzlr/easy_lessons/","title":"Easy Lessons","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T02:38:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 02:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lchzlr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lchzlr/easy_lessons/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lchzlr/easy_lessons/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"stonedgill","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/stonedgill","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"stonedgill","score":49,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"简单的课程","the_new_excerpt":"我最近学到了一些很重要的东西。\n\n不要为了潜在的赢家而出卖赢家。\n\n我一直处于这样的情况，我正在建立我的个人业务，所以。\n虽然我一直做得很好 任何额外的收入或现金都将回到帮助\n我发展我的生意。这让我陷入了困境... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"簡單的課程","the_new_excerpt":"我最近學到了一些很重要的東西。\n\n不要爲了潛在的贏家而出賣贏家。\n\n我一直處於這樣的情況，我正在建立我的個人業務，所以。\n雖然我一直做得很好 任何額外的收入或現金都將回到幫助\n我發展我的生意。這讓我陷入了困境... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-llka1g","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llka1g/2k_to_90k_with_everybodys_favorite_play/","title":"$2K to $90K with everybody’s favorite play","date":"February 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"2千到9万，大家最喜欢的玩法。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"2千到9萬，大家最喜歡的玩法。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1362077651322740736","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1362077651322740736","title":"% below January high...\nBlockbuster $BLIAQ: -92%\nGameStop $GME: -90%\nKoss $KOSS: -89%\nExpress $EXPR: -83%\nNew Concept $GBR: -78%\nAMC $AMC: -74%\nNokia $NOK: -58%\nMacerich $MAC: -52%\nBed Bath $BBBY: -51%\nTootsie Roll $TR: -49%\nNat.
