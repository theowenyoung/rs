Due to social distancing measures and the general growth of the video game industry, Discord nearly doubled its userbase and saw revenue spike to $130 million in 2020. It was valued at $7 billion in December, and is reportedly is not yet profitable.</p>\n\n<p>That would seem to leave Microsoft as the last real domestic contender here. It has pre-existing ties to Discord, as you can already link your Xbox account directly to the service; it’s certainly got the money, with $131 billion in total cash as of Dec. 31; and it’s reportedly still in the market for more gaming-focused acquisitions, even after finalizing its purchase of ZeniMax Media earlier this month.</p>\n\n<p>This is a positive move to acquire discord. It will make msft more competitive and improve social media business, which might make it able to compete with facebook. It will definitely help the gaming business as well as msft putting more effort to improve the gaming revenue.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mb52jz/why_microsoft_would_want_to_acquire_discord_which/","title":"Why Microsoft would want to acquire Discord, which is reportedly exploring a $10B-plus sale","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-23T06:28:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-23 06:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mb52jz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mb52jz/why_microsoft_would_want_to_acquire_discord_which/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mb52jz/why_microsoft_would_want_to_acquire_discord_which/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"coolcomfort123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/coolcomfort123","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"coolcomfort123","score":785,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"据报道，微软为何要收购Discord，据说Discord正在探讨100多亿美元的出售。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-want-acquire-discord-reportedly-exploring-10b-plus-sale/\n\nDiscord是一款深受百万游戏玩家喜爱的低延迟语音聊天应用。\n和其他通信。由于社会疏远措施和普遍\n电子游戏行业的发展，Discord... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"據報道，微軟爲何要收購Discord，據說Discord正在探討100多億美元的出售。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-want-acquire-discord-reportedly-exploring-10b-plus-sale/\n\nDiscord是一款深受百萬遊戲玩家喜愛的低延遲語音聊天應用。\n和其他通信。由於社會疏遠措施和普遍\n電子遊戲行業的發展，Discord... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mrpeym","excerpt":"I noticed today BRK-A's volume was 1,719 today (4/15) and the average is 14 and\nthe stock moved 0.44% (as per yahoo).\n\nForgive me if this was asked already, but I couldn't find anything.
