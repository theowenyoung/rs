Any mention of any growth company gets met with negative, pessimistic and unrealistic attitude. Everyone says to stay away from &#39;reddit stocks&#39; which seems to be the new term for &#39;meme stocks&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Ever since everything that happened with Gamestop, it now seems taboo to invest in anything that isn&#39;t MSFT or AAPL or SPY. There used to be more discussion surrounding undervalued stocks. Discussion surrounding anything other than value has diminished almost entirely and everyone asking for advice surrounding growth just gets the same mindless response from the zombies that infest this sub. &quot;No revenue = Shit company,&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t buy anything you see people talk about on reddit,&quot; &quot;Hype for growth stocks is dead&quot; so on and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>Ignoring the fact that 95% of all growth stocks just dropped anywhere from 30-70% in the last couple months(and some are prime for loading up), why does everyone still seem to think that everything is overvalued? Why does it seem like almost no one is talking about investing with the future in mind. Everyone is only talking about today/short term, and most people seem very bearish about literally any investment. </p>\n\n<p>I never really think to follow this advice, but in my opinion I haven&#39;t seen this fearful of a market in the 3 years I&#39;ve been investing. I haven&#39;t been around for the longest but I do know that most of the pessimism surrounding growth right now is unreasonable and downright stupid. I&#39;ve been using this opportunity to &#39;be greedy when others are fearful&#39;. I have allocated a decent amount of my portfolio betting on growth stocks that get all the hype when they&#39;re going up, but everyone hates them when they&#39;re going down. </p>\n\n<p>&#39;Last years picks&#39; is a term I hear a lot lately, and I find it funny. Everyone wants a piece of the pie that no one can afford but when everyone can afford it, no one talks about it. It&#39;s really interesting to see how many people are willing to jump into a <a href=\"mailto:S.P.@.C\">S.P.@.C</a>. or a growth company after it shoots up 300%, and when it corrects people don&#39;t make the reasonable conclusion of &#39;maybe I bought the hype and now I need to ask myself if it&#39;s worth holding and if I like this company&#39;. Instead, the overwhelming sentiment becomes &#39;Man, this company is shit. Why the hell did I buy it? It would be better to sell at a loss, forget about this company and put it all into SPY, the safer play.&#39; I don&#39;t know who has noticed, but value is at all time highs and growth is at all time lows. Which has more room to grow, and which seems like the better investment right now? I think it&#39;s obvious.</p>\n\n<p>When most sectors are down on no news, it clearly has nothing to do with the company. EVs, Gene stocks, growth stocks, <a href=\"mailto:S.P.@.Cs\">S.P.@.Cs</a>, etc etc are all down rn. That doesn&#39;t mean the companies are all garbage and going bankrupt like most people are saying. If one stock drops 30% because of bad news, understandable, but that&#39;s not the current situation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mwzgik/does_anyone_in_this_sub_take_risks_or_is_everyone/","title":"Does Anyone In This Sub Take Risks?
