It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.</li>\n<li>They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware</li>\n<li>Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Nano Dimension - DD is from their website</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&amp;D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Quantum Computing</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>IonQ - $DMYI</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way</li>\n<li>The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate</a>), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.</li>\n<li>So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what&#39;s called a logical qubit. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits</a>).</li>\n<li>It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years (<a href=\"https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap\">https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap</a>)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Robotic process automation</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blue Prism - $PRSM - Need DD</strong></li>\n<li><strong>UiPath - $UIPTH (IPO later this year)</strong></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mauium/best_stocks_for_the_fourth_industrial_revolution/","title":"Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolution","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-22T21:02:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-22 21:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mauium","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mauium/best_stocks_for_the_fourth_industrial_revolution/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mauium/best_stocks_for_the_fourth_industrial_revolution/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"SnooObjections2665","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooObjections2665","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"SnooObjections2665","score":3519,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"第四次工业革命的最佳股票","the_new_excerpt":"第四次工业革命的特点是数字的融合。\n以及越来越多地利用新的生物、物理和物理世界，以及越来越多地利用新的技术。\n技术。是自动化和数据交换的趋势，在。\n制造技术和工艺，包括： * 网络物理..:\n\n * 网络物理...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"第四次工業革命的最佳股票","the_new_excerpt":"第四次工業革命的特點是數字的融合。\n以及越來越多地利用新的生物、物理和物理世界，以及越來越多地利用新的技術。\n技術。是自動化和數據交換的趨勢，在。\n製造技術和工藝，包括： * 網絡物理..:\n\n * 網絡物理...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mrk274","excerpt":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/dow-soars-new-record-high-after-retail-sales-boom-lowest-n1264174\n\n> The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 34,000 mark for the first time in\n> history on Thursday, as Wall Street surged to new record highs after a slew of\n> positive economic data,…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mrk274/dow_hits_34000_after_retail_sales_boom_lowest/","title":"Dow hits 34,000 after retail sales boom, lowest weekly jobless claims since pandemic began","date":"April 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"小売売上高が好調でダウは34,000ドルに到達、週間失業保険申請件数はパンデミック後最低となる","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/dow-soars-new-record-high-after-retail-sales-boom-lowest-n1264174\n\n> ダウ平均株価が史上初めて34,000ドルの大台に乗りました。\n> 史上初となる34,000ドルの大台を突破し、ウォール街は史上最高値を更新しました。\n> 肯定的な経済指標、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"道指在零售销售繁荣后触及34000点，每周申请失业救济人数为疫情开始以来最低。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/dow-soars-new-record-high-after-retail-sales-boom-lowest-n1264174\n\n> 道琼斯工业平均指数首次突破34000点大关。\n>历史上周四，华尔街在经历了一系列的暴涨之后，创下了历史新高。\n>积极的经济数据，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"道指在零售銷售繁榮後觸及34000點，每週申請失業救濟人數爲疫情開始以來最低。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/dow-soars-new-record-high-after-retail-sales-boom-lowest-n1264174\n\n> 道瓊斯工業平均指數首次突破34000點大關。\n>歷史上週四，華爾街在經歷了一系列的暴漲之後，創下了歷史新高。\n>積極的經濟數據，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mrhnbx","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrhnbx/still_buying_more_also_cashed_in_my_ira_to_go/","title":"Still buying more!
