At the start of GME movement I was at $31,000. After GME was over I finished with a total of $84,000 and felt depressed because I could&#39;ve sold when it was $105,000 but I was greedy. Not only that, but soon after I spent $10,000 on a very stupid AMC play. Then a very stupid play (Lucid) which I will not mention that got me down to $66,000. With that $66,000. I have $20,000 sitting in NIO and $10,000 in ARKF. I&#39;ve been feeling like a piece of crap for not having made more out of these trades but then I have to realize I went from a total of $17,000 invested total to $66,000 and that&#39;s not so bad, but shit I feel so WEIRD. Mind you I make only $29,000 salary after tax right now so it would&#39;ve meant so much to cash out at $105,000. This is all tax free account for those concerned</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lnsa2h/why_am_i_not_satisfied_why_is_greed_a_thing/","title":"Why am I not satisfied, why is greed a thing.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T13:23:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 13:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lnsa2h","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnsa2h/why_am_i_not_satisfied_why_is_greed_a_thing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnsa2h/why_am_i_not_satisfied_why_is_greed_a_thing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"saadbruh","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/saadbruh","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"saadbruh","score":70,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1367833524594634752","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1367833524594634752","title":"Have now launched Occasio Capital Ltd as an independent research firm, seeking to publish jargon-free equity research for retail investors.
