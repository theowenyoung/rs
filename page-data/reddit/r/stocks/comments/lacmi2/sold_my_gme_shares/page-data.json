I fear that a lot of those guys have been indcotrinated by the hype. Any comment even slightly against the grain or has a notion of common sense to it gets down voted to hell within a few seconds and removed. At this point I&#39;m convinced that wsb has either been hijacked by hf insiders continuing to drive the buy hype or they are complete investing noobs that have no idea what they&#39;re doing thinking they&#39;ll cash out in a few days. I mean some of the profiles who are spamming this nonsensical  shit that I look into are just kids who don&#39;t know any better, either cashing out their savings or maxing out credit cards in order to buy more shares. At this point it seems advantageous for the big players to drive the hype and nobody over there realizes it. The spike already happened and the smart people got out, you don&#39;t see any posts of people who are still gaining rather you only see screenshots of people throwing all they got at the stock. Sad to say but the stock will continue to decline and along with it you may see the tribalism increase and concentrate to a small group of individuals unable to come to terms with reality. This seems to be the future of wsb.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lacmi2/sold_my_gme_shares/","title":"Sold my gme shares","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T22:30:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 22:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lacmi2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lacmi2/sold_my_gme_shares/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lacmi2/sold_my_gme_shares/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"dirtsequence","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/dirtsequence","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"dirtsequence","score":73,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"卖出我的GME股票","the_new_excerpt":"只有几股，但受不了这个社会了。我担心，一个\n很多人都是被炒作所迷惑。任何评论，即使是稍微\n逆来顺受\n几秒钟内就被删除了。在这一点上我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"賣出我的GME股票","the_new_excerpt":"只有幾股，但受不了這個社會了。我擔心，一個\n很多人都是被炒作所迷惑。任何評論，即使是稍微\n逆來順受\n幾秒鐘內就被刪除了。在這一點上我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-libwy6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/libwy6/racing_to_sell_my_stocks_that_i_see_featured_on/","title":"Racing to sell my stocks that I see featured on WSB and CNBC","date":"February 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"竞相出售我在WSB和CNBC上看到的股票。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"競相出售我在WSB和CNBC上看到的股票。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-li0yu5","excerpt":"I've noticed newer people aren't sure how this works.
