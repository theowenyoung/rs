And I think we see a lot of technology companies that want to get into health but don&#39;t know that, make mistakes because they&#39;re not intimately familiar. And what I can bring to Palantir is my expertise as a clinician, as a public health doc, as somebody who has been working in this field for years to help with the science and the strategy and the relationships.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Investing in tech for the next pandemic</p>\n\n<p>In his new role, Kassler said, he wants to help put Palantir&#39;s technology in the hands of researchers who can use it to make smart decisions in the next pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>He highlighted three areas that he believes can be improved with the help of tech solutions like Palantir&#39;s: patching supply chain issues, dealing with localized surges of cases, and tackling racial and ethnic disparities.</p>\n\n<p>Palantir&#39;s Foundry platform has played a significant role in the U.S. government&#39;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as private companies&#39; handling of essential supply chains. Palantir&#39;s technology allows researchers to combine and overlay datasets in ways that can make supply chain weaknesses or outbreak hotspots more obvious, allowing them to act quickly on their findings.</p>\n\n<p>On the government side, the National Institutes of Health has recently begun using Palantir&#39;s platform to combine datasets from 50 different academic groups that it funds in ways that would have been cumbersome without the software.</p>\n\n<p>Palantir&#39;s technology helps the groups share data in ways that protects patient identities but allows them to gain more insights by analyzing a much larger dataset than they would have access to in their individual group settings. Julie Bush, who leads Palantir&#39;s federal health care work, said the data is now being used to better understand how the Covid-19 has impacted people with different backgrounds and conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Bush said that type of broad data-sharing was less common prior to the pandemic, but that she hopes it continues after.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;People love to hoard their data,&quot; she said. &quot;And the pandemic really forced people to come together and be willing to share information and sort of set the bureaucracy aside. And, of course subject to data use agreements and other things, what we really saw was incredible collaborations happening across the government.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Kassler said he wants to see the technology used for more everyday use cases, too. One example he gave is how the Centers for Disease Control has already used the technology to help narrow the possible sources of an outbreak linked to produce. Rather than recalling produce from a large region, Palantir can help the agency trace the supply chain and pinpoint a smaller target.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We don&#39;t know what the next pandemic will be,&quot; Kassler said. &quot;So we have to be prepared. And in order to do that we have to have invested in the systems that are able to have that situational awareness and to be able to enable organizations to respond quickly.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/n3tdg7/palantir_hires_former_ibm_watson_health_exec_as/","title":"Palantir hires former IBM Watson Health exec as first US government chief medical officer","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"May 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-03T12:37:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-03 12:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n3tdg7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n3tdg7/palantir_hires_former_ibm_watson_health_exec_as/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n3tdg7/palantir_hires_former_ibm_watson_health_exec_as/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"NineteenSixtySix","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NineteenSixtySix","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"NineteenSixtySix","score":357,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"パランティアが元IBMワトソンヘルスの幹部を米国政府初のチーフメディカルオフィサーとして採用","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/palantir-hires-former-ibm-watson-health-exec.html\n\nパランティアは、IBMのワトソンヘルス事業の元幹部である、初の米国政府のチーフメディカルオフィサーを採用しました。\nIBMのワトソンヘルス事業の元幹部で、米国政府初のチーフメディカルオフィサーを採用しました。\nこれは、データ分析会社がライフサイエンス事業を強化するためです。\n\n同社は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Palantir公司聘请前IBM Watson Health执行官担任美国政府首位首席医疗官","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/palantir-hires-former-ibm-watson-health-exec.html\n\nPalantir公司聘请了其首位美国政府首席医疗官，他曾是IB公司的高管。\n他曾是IBM公司沃森健康业务的高管，因为这家数据分析公司\n数据分析公司加倍努力发展其生命科学业务。\n\n虽然该公司...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Palantir公司聘請前IBM Watson Health執行官擔任美國政府首位首席醫療官","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/palantir-hires-former-ibm-watson-health-exec.html\n\nPalantir公司聘請了其首位美國政府首席醫療官，他曾是IB公司的高管。\n他曾是IBM公司沃森健康業務的高管，因爲這家數據分析公司\n數據分析公司加倍努力發展其生命科學業務。\n\n雖然該公司...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n3ppiw","excerpt":"I currently hold Ford (and a couple other pure EVs) as longer-term auto/EV\nplays.
