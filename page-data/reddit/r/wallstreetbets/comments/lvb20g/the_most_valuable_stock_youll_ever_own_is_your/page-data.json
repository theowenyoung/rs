This is not just a number on a spreadsheet to many of us, it’s a house, it’s a car payment, it’s insurance...  We have a lot riding on this.</p>\n\n<p>I am very fortunate that I am only investing in this as a game and I don’t need to win money to pay off debts or feed myself, but I still found that when my $220 turned into $4k, it was a very very visceral experience.  It was well all I could think about that entire day and night, even into the next morning.  </p>\n\n<p>Maybe you see where this is going.  I believe the truth is that we are doing a good thing, we are swindling the swindlers, and it feels damn good, BUT, and I don’t mean to poop on everyone’s party, I can only see this as having a bad ending, where people put lots and lots of money in and they eventually change the rules so that we can’t win anymore and we’d have to move onto the next thing, and the hedge funds will be fine and go back to scamming America while a lot of us who can’t afford to lose much lose all their money and now have an expectation that the stock market will spit out crazy returns, which it won’t.</p>\n\n<p>The big institutions have always made the majority of their money by preying on everyday Americans instincts to buy and sell, they make money off of the activity, it doesn’t matter if it goes up or down really, they just try to sucker as many people as possible into putting as much money into stocks so they can make money off commissions, fees etc.</p>\n\n<p>Heed this warning please, don’t get caught up in the dopamine loop, don’t get left with an addiction in the stock market.  In the long term your mental health is much more important than any returns, the money is just the points in the game, your brain is your seat of consciousness through which you interpret everything, it’s a shitty shitty trade to trade one ounce of mental well-being for any amount of money really.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb20g/the_most_valuable_stock_youll_ever_own_is_your/","title":"The most valuable stock you’ll ever own is your own brain.
