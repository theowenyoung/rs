For now, just wait, buy, and hold if you&#39;re confident in GME. Not financial advice.</p>\n\n<p>Position: 60@77 GME</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Also, SI numbers have NOT been updated yet, so just be patient. 6pm EST seems to be the &quot;expected&quot; time. Those people linking or saying 226.42 SI are wrong, those numbers are not updated and are old.</p>\n\n<p>Just be patient folks. As has always been since the beginning of the GME ventures, there&#39;s a lot of money to be gained or lost on either &quot;side&quot;, so just remain vigilant use your logic (not emotions) when deciding to buy/sell/hold.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lge1fl/get_prepared_for_a_downvote_brigade_and/","title":"Get prepared for a downvote brigade and post/comment removals!","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T18:34:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 18:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lge1fl","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lge1fl/get_prepared_for_a_downvote_brigade_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lge1fl/get_prepared_for_a_downvote_brigade_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"GarnByte","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GarnByte","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"GarnByte","score":2465,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"做好降权大队和帖子/评论删除的准备!","the_new_excerpt":"GME的小幅飙升（AMC的程度较低），显然人们\n正在预期的空头兴趣仍会很高。无论是否\n是否是真相（甚至如果金融业监管局的数字是可靠的）是另一个。\n故事。\n\n不管怎么说，天马行空和叙事控制... ...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"做好降權大隊和帖子/評論刪除的準備!","the_new_excerpt":"GME的小幅飆升（AMC的程度較低），顯然人們\n正在預期的空頭興趣仍會很高。無論是否\n是否是真相（甚至如果金融業監管局的數字是可靠的）是另一個。\n故事。\n\n不管怎麼說，天馬行空和敘事控制... ...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lrmqr5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrmqr5/im_still_in/","title":"I’m still in.","date":"February 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我还在。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我還在。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lrnn1p","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrnn1p/100_gain_this_rocket_is_taking_off/","title":"100% gain.
