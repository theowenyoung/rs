I sort of expected the relative volumes to be comparable in ratio, but they&#39;re not.</p>\n\n<p>No, in fact there is some SERIOUS delay in tracking when markets start to swell up in short volume. If you look at Figure 1 you can see that they don&#39;t really seem to follow each other at all most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Except, when the different market volumes DO start to overlap and follow each other, THAT is when we see the larger dips in stock prices for those days!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now if you look at Jan 27th and Feb 10th in Figure 1 you&#39;ll see that NASDAQ PSX short volume peaked high, and FINRA and NASDAQ Boston synced up and peaked the very next day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2dj8tyjpqzg61.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99aba3f5759d0272c401877acdef93cfea37e73d\">Figure 1: Jan28th and Feb 11th were the largest dips, and also when NASDAQ B and FINRA short volumes started to sync up! </a></p>\n\n<p>Yes, it is really easy with hindsight 20/20 to say &quot;OH YEA IT WAS IN THE DATA RIGHT THERE&quot; but I noticed something from another &quot;penny stock&quot; and made the same plot for the different volumes in the market.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f5a16zi7tzg61.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d631425582fb2593c9041ecc90805bdd2e231861\">Figure 2: Same plot for different stock, showing similar trends as SNDL.</a></p>\n\n<p>Here, we again see the THREE DIFFERENT MARKETS dont usually line up, but when THEY DO START TO SYNC, the price has the largest dips the next day!</p>\n\n<p>So if this is correct, than it&#39;s possible to see dip the next day <strong>IF the NASDAQ PSX ShortVolume and FINRA Short Volume begin to move together</strong> towards a peak.
