This seriously is not helping any of your positions. You&#39;re more likely to dump what might be a solid play too early because you&#39;re staring at the ticker and have TP hands and panic when SPY is down 1% for the day. Think about all the times where if you held a position for a little while longer you would&#39;ve printed. Robinhood looks amazing as an app and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. If the sell button is right in front of you at all times, you&#39;re gonna be more likely to dump when you shouldn&#39;t. Get a broker with a shitty looking UI so you aren&#39;t glued to a chart all day. Trust me, your relationships and work will thank you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Access to penny stocks</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ever want to trade OTC penny stocks and make some real bank? It might be a good thing that some people don&#39;t have access to them given the inherent risk. But for some unknown reason, RH makes it easy to yolo your whole life savings into 0DTE so penny stocks are pretty safe compared to the options you can trade.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote a DD on a penny stock on another subreddit and I got DMs about how to buy it on RH. Bruh please stop. Use a real broker.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Actual customer support</strong></p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t used Robinhood customer support for anything, but I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s god awful. I&#39;m gonna sound like a shill, but I&#39;ve been using Schwab for the past six years and the customer support is amazing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instant transfers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Again, gonna sound like I work for Schwab or something (I wish). Schwab and many other big banks allow you to instant transfer from your checking/savings to your brokerage account with no limit. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Huge assets under management</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have 6.6, 3.3, and 3.23 trillion AUM. That&#39;s a lot of focken money. These brokers had no issues with the clearinghouses and did not limit trading on meme stocks. Gee Em Eeeeee would probably be 2000 if everyone used them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cool desktop/web apps</strong></p>\n\n<p>Wanna look like a cool badass trader to pickup bitches at your local library? Schwab has a FREE trading platform with many cool features like the dark pool block trades. Add fancy crayons and lines to your charts too! Not gonna lie this app probably makes it harder to stop looking at stonks all day thus defeating point number 1. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kco97ssy16i61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccb7623017890bb5a0ea17d471ea54bec64c0f19\">Stolen from google images</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Cons of not using Robinhood</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not blind to the pros of Robinhood. </p>\n\n<p>- Looks cool</p>\n\n<p>- Options are free (Schwab charges $0.65 per option contract)</p>\n\n<p>- Easy to use</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So please, do yourself a favor and use a real broker :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lme4i6/youre_unironically_retarded_if_youre_still_using/","title":"You're unironically retarded if you're still using Robinhood","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-18T14:24:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-18 14:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lme4i6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lme4i6/youre_unironically_retarded_if_youre_still_using/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lme4i6/youre_unironically_retarded_if_youre_still_using/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"xXx_Bunga_xXx","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/xXx_Bunga_xXx","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"xXx_Bunga_xXx","score":7013,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果你还在用罗宾汉的身份，你就会被讽刺为弱智了","the_new_excerpt":"你看，我得到，你们中的一些人真正试图转移到另一个经纪人，但。\n你对石器市场的合法赌瘾被阻止了。\n你不会平仓所有的头寸，并让你的交易结算（即使是你自己的交易）。\n虽然如果你这样做，你可能不会失去80％的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你還在用羅賓漢的身份，你就會被諷刺爲弱智了","the_new_excerpt":"你看，我得到，你們中的一些人真正試圖轉移到另一個經紀人，但。\n你對石器市場的合法賭癮被阻止了。\n你不會平倉所有的頭寸，並讓你的交易結算（即使是你自己的交易）。\n雖然如果你這樣做，你可能不會失去80％的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lx6y06","excerpt":"Hi team,\n\nI had a lot of traction with my previous post on $ARKK so I thought I would lay\nout a very simple case as to why, in my view and others, we may experience more\ninflation in the coming years than the US has experienced in the last 50 years,\nand the potential implications of such a…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lx6y06/the_case_for_inflation_simple_math_in_laymans/","title":"The case for inflation: Simple math in layman's terms","date":"March 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"通货膨胀的案例。用通俗的语言进行简单的计算","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，团队。\n\n我之前在$ARKK上的文章有很多牵引力，所以我想我应该把我的文章放在\n阐述了一个非常简单的案例，在我和其他人看来，为什么我们会经历更多的。\n未来几年的通货膨胀率比美国过去50年经历的还要高。\n的潜在影响。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"通貨膨脹的案例。用通俗的語言進行簡單的計算","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，團隊。\n\n我之前在$ARKK上的文章有很多牽引力，所以我想我應該把我的文章放在\n闡述了一個非常簡單的案例，在我和其他人看來，爲什麼我們會經歷更多的。\n未來幾年的通貨膨脹率比美國過去50年經歷的還要高。\n的潛在影響。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lwwkiz","excerpt":"Guys, this rocket has been like the SpaceX Boosters, they get close to space but\nalways touch back down to earth...
