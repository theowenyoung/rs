So take us through what&#39;s going in your mind right now?”</p>\n\n<p>JR RAHN: Well, look, I think we had a massive run-up on Friday and also on Monday. This was a very hotly-anticipated listing by many of our shareholders. And so I think now that we are on NASDAQ, we&#39;re going to start to see a little bit of some stability here today. It seems to be re-tracing a bit. But you know, this isn&#39;t just about share price. This is really about-- NASDAQ is about, how do we allocate capital to mental health?</p>\n\n<p>And how do we build an entire new industry? These are still very early innings for us. And so we&#39;re not going to be dictated by the day-to-day fluctuations or hour-by-hout fluctuations of our stock. We have 180,000 shareholders last time I checked, and a lot of them are very mission-driven. I think, yes, they are interested in investing into us for gains, but I think, importantly, a lot of them share what 40% of the US currently shares, which is that they have a form of mental illness or addiction at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>And so this is not just about investing. This is about investing in a company that is going to have a large impact on society. And that really is our mission.</p>\n\n<p>“You mentioned your investor base-- you&#39;ve got some pretty passionate investors there. And I understand you&#39;re also trending on WallStreetBets today-- not quite sure if investors are seeing MindMed as one of those meme-type stocks like we saw with AMC and GameStop. But what&#39;s your take on what you&#39;re seeing happening sort of at the grassroots level with investors-- with individual investors and your company right now?”</p>\n\n<p>JR RAHN: Well, these are chaotic times. And when you have chaotic times, both in the markets and in society, mental health is a big component and a problem that needs to be looked at. I think our being mentioned in WallStreetBets and on our MindMed investors club-- this is just a natural outcry from normal people that want to see a change in mental health. And suddenly, they can identify with something.</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s great. I love to have empowered and passionate shareholders. We&#39;re very, very receptive and supportive. And you know, I think there&#39;s been a lot of hype around WallStreetBets, and meme stocks, and all of these things. But at the end of the day, people make markets. And it&#39;s great to have the people behind us.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0ghph/mindmed_mnmd_ceo_on_going_public_but_at_the_end/","title":"MindMed ($MNMD) CEO on going public: “But at the end of the day, people make markets.”","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"April 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-28T19:05:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-28 19:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n0ghph","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0ghph/mindmed_mnmd_ceo_on_going_public_but_at_the_end/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0ghph/mindmed_mnmd_ceo_on_going_public_but_at_the_end/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"XRedVelvett","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/XRedVelvett","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"XRedVelvett","score":2654,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"MindMed（$MNMD）のCEOが株式公開について。\"しかし、結局のところ、人が市場を作るのだ\"","the_new_excerpt":"マインドメッド社CEOインタビュー\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mindmed-ceo-going-public-allocate-184100037.html]\n\nインタビューから得られたいくつかの収穫。\n\n\"今日、NASDAQで大きなデビューを果たしましたが、株を見てみると26％も下がっています。\n26%. 今、何を考えているのか教えてください」。\n\nJR RAHN:...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"MindMed ($MNMD)首席执行官谈上市。\"但在一天结束时，人们创造了市场。\"","the_new_excerpt":"采访明德公司CEO\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mindmed-ceo-going-public-allocate-184100037.html]\n\n采访中的一些收获。\n\n\"今天在纳斯达克的首次亮相很重要，但我看了看股票，它下跌了\n26%. 那么，请告诉我们你现在的想法是什么？\"\n\nJR RAHN：...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"MindMed ($MNMD)首席執行官談上市。\"但在一天結束時，人們創造了市場。\"","the_new_excerpt":"採訪明德公司CEO\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mindmed-ceo-going-public-allocate-184100037.html]\n\n採訪中的一些收穫。\n\n\"今天在納斯達克的首次亮相很重要，但我看了看股票，它下跌了\n26%. 那麼，請告訴我們你現在的想法是什麼？\"\n\nJR RAHN：...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n0e2ab","excerpt":"Disclaimer: I'm long PINS - in fact it's one of my highest conviction holdings.\n\nThere's a fair bit of confusion about the stock dropping so much in light of a\nbig earnings beat, so I thought I would provide some thoughts for any other\nlongs or potential buyers.
