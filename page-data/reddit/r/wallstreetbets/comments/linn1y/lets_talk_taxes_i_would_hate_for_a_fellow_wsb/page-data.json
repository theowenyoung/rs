Especially if you have a Normal day job salary as well. I would hate to see a fellow WSB go to jail for not paying taxes. Don’t go spending that money quite yet because once tax season rolls around next may 2022 you might owe the government $50,000+ in taxes for that 6 figure profit you made off GameStop for example. Just hoping this doesn’t get deleted by the mods and can educate others. </p>\n\n<p>To get around this invest in companies that you want to hold for 12 months or more. Then you only pay 15% on taxes instead of potentially 60% (for top earners). Same goes for houses and any appreciating asset.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/linn1y/lets_talk_taxes_i_would_hate_for_a_fellow_wsb/","title":"Let’s talk taxes!
