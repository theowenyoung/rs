It still blows my mind why wall street hates this company.\nWe know the boomers are retarded, but you literally cannot be that much retarded to undervalue this goddam stock. But enough with chit chat. I am talking about our favourite fruit #BB.</p>\n\n<p>Just to put it into perspective… Blackberry has a market capitalisation of 5.12B and a total valuation of around 6B. Total turnover was around 890 million.\nJust for comparison cloudflare inc. has a total market cap. Of 23B with a total valuation of 21B while having a total turnover of approx. 430 million.

Reasons for the dip? Honestly I don’t get it. There are literally only positive news for the future.
