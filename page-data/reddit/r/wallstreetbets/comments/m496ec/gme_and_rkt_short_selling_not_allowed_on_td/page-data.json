Crazy amazing unexpected growth and profitability. The share price went from $19.90 to $21.85...

(youtube links not allowed)</p>\n\n<p>So what do the shorts do? They DOUBLE DOWN as they always do!</p>\n\n<p>They unload millions of new shorts to attack the price:</p>\n\n<p>On March 4th they have dropped the price to $26.80.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This chart shows the available short shares to borrow and the fee. On March 4th there are ONLY 100,000 shares available and a HUGE BORROWING FEE OF 59%</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rgtiqziljtm61.png?width=1243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3979f04d5b95acb8b0a097642ff84bbfe185e553\">https://preview.redd.it/rgtiqziljtm61.png?width=1243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3979f04d5b95acb8b0a097642ff84bbfe185e553</a></p>\n\n<p>Data from here: <a href=\"https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT\">https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT</a></p>\n\n<p>In the meantime paper-handed retail investors HAVE SOLD to this very obvious GME tactic once again and there are now more shorts available! These guys are so good at doubling down.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt\">Market Watch calls Short Interest at 40% on Feb 26th. Since the price went up and they just shorted millions more shares you can bet your sweet bananas short interest is probably higher.</a></p>\n\n<p>From a technical analysis POV the chart has 3 trailing support lines. In other words the price is very unlikely to dip below $23.50. Your downside is very minimal.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ry9hxdfmjtm61.png?width=2118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dff7ec2116f2f0de0bfdd5be0a7ae90f6318967\">https://preview.redd.it/ry9hxdfmjtm61.png?width=2118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dff7ec2116f2f0de0bfdd5be0a7ae90f6318967</a></p>\n\n<p>The morning of March 12th RKT was UP in pre-market. When the market opened there was huge volume and price drove down, killed the momentum and people thought they lost.</p>\n\n<p>During that same time MILLIONS of shorts were fired:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q8yr8b5njtm61.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d55b9cbcddae79869becb78017a1832a6b4dfeda\">https://preview.redd.it/q8yr8b5njtm61.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d55b9cbcddae79869becb78017a1832a6b4dfeda</a></p>\n\n<p>Shares available went from 5.6M to 1.9M. Then retail SOLD.... You weak apes.</p>\n\n<p>The OPEN INTEREST for MARCH 19th OUT THE MONEY IS INSANE.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6pu6cv0ojtm61.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a945e90e1e0dfeeef8d416156dca3c3635a26c3e\">https://preview.redd.it/6pu6cv0ojtm61.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a945e90e1e0dfeeef8d416156dca3c3635a26c3e</a></p>\n\n<p>Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).</p>\n\n<p>In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That&#39;s about a 300% return from current price.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don&#39;t know the date yet but that&#39;s making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qelq19cpjtm61.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1177d9ce4e4baf2b65056ad52ef14f108b1c7da4\">https://preview.redd.it/qelq19cpjtm61.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1177d9ce4e4baf2b65056ad52ef14f108b1c7da4</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>\n\n<p>RKT is one of the most manipulated prices since IPO. Despite amazing performance, surprise earnings, dividends and buyback announcements the stock has been held under $24.</p>\n\n<p>The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.</p>\n\n<p>RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won&#39;t take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We&#39;re at $25... It&#39;s not a lot to ask for.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This is no financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m496ec/gme_and_rkt_short_selling_not_allowed_on_td/","title":"$GME and $RKT SHORT SELLING NOT ALLOWED ON TD","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-13T21:35:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-13 21:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m496ec","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m496ec/gme_and_rkt_short_selling_not_allowed_on_td/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m496ec/gme_and_rkt_short_selling_not_allowed_on_td/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"bosshax","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bosshax","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bosshax","score":3835,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"不允许在TD上卖空$GME和$RKT。","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/xctwvijejtm61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc3f82e8786d22fc44d00b6f9114ed282f2b44a1\n\n链接在TD上的人谁不相信我，因为我很美\n[https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page]\n\n请看我关于GME和其他股票的帖子，从...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不允許在TD上賣空$GME和$RKT。","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/xctwvijejtm61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc3f82e8786d22fc44d00b6f9114ed282f2b44a1\n\n鏈接在TD上的人誰不相信我，因爲我很美\n[https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page]\n\n請看我關於GME和其他股票的帖子，從...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1377370897816895490","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1377370897816895490","title":"1.
