We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled. \n<a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3806065\">https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3806065</a></p>\n\n<p>It’s from last week but apparently it has only 2000 views. Give it a read.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: why is it pouring with downvotes? The paper has 4000 views now and only 300 upvotes? I just want people to read it for a little confidence boost. This needs to go to <a href=\"/r/all\">r/all</a> for the world to witness</p>\n\n<p>Edit: this post got so many reports on <a href=\"/r/GME\">r/GME</a>, it’s been removed two times already.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as you see a rocket, you upvote. Also loads of shitposting from newcomers. It’s not just lols. You’re missing on actual information because good content is reported and downvoted by the shills and never makes it to 50 upvotes.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: it’s them posting the memes and shit for karma because there’s a big percentage here who will upvote. Especially between each other. Stop fucking around with these guys. This is the no fuck around gang. They ruined our parents lives and ours too. THEY ARE COMING AT US IN OUR OWN HOUSE.
