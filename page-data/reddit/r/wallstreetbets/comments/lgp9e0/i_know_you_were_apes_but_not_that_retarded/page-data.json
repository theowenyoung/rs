And now we&#39;re not together, because they spread lies, misinformation and doubt on reddit, news and magazines. They can trick the DUMB. Are you dumb?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not going to lie, I first joined the whole train for the fast money and bought @270€ for 2k€, because I have debts of 10k€ and a lawsuit going against me.

Stop whining, stop getting in doubt.</p>\n\n<p>For ONE fucking time in your life - just do <strong>NOTHING</strong> and <strong>HOLD</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>WSB showed the whole world how fucked up the market is.
