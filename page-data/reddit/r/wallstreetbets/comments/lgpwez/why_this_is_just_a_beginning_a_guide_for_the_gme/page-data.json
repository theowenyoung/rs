Some of you might remember me when I told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$ <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7i28q/gme_launching_right_about_now_microsoft_agreement/\">when MSFT deal happened</a>, by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcjqba/gme_long_thesis_why_40_target_is_actually_a/\">my DD about why GameStop is worth 138$</a> or by my other posts I&#39;ve made here for months. As you&#39;ve noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I&#39;m down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don&#39;t fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.</p>\n\n<p>Now get these points through your thick head:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>This is a fucking volatile stock.</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while, 🌈🐻 keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the amplitude getting larger and larger. And every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I wish I bought at $9...&quot; - when it shot up to $13, and them came down</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I wish I bought at $11...&quot; - when it shot up to $20, and them came down</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I wish I bought at $17...&quot; - when it shot up to $70, and them came down</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I wish I bought at $40...&quot; - when it shot up to $150, and them came down</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I wish I bought at $60...&quot; - when it shot up to $450, and them came down</p>\n\n<p><strong>Being in GME gang was always about not caring about temporary swings, because in the end, the price always sets a new ATH</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen this shit happening so many times since October that I just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 5-6 digits.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GME was never a squeeze play</strong>, despite what a lot of you retards think. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read any DD more than a month old, the whole company is massively undervalued . Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires\">Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy’s Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC</a> (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aimé of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That&#39;s 12x bagger and I&#39;m being very conservative here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it&#39;s true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the 🌈🐻s</strong>. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.</p>\n\n<p>MOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play</p>\n\n<p>Also, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Short interest is still through fucking roof</strong>. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know you&#39;re used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it&#39;s still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen&#39;s success, which I don&#39;t doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\\reward is massively skewed to the upside</p>\n\n<p>If you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it&#39;s unbearable for you, but ultimately you&#39;ll be fucking loaded. This is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000+ and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paper-handed bitches in the comments scream &quot;WOW HE FUCKING HELD GRATZ&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions:</strong> some Apr 40c, some Apr 200c and a shitload of Jan 2023 950c. Will dump the remaining cash into 2023 calls at open</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgpwez/why_this_is_just_a_beginning_a_guide_for_the_gme/","title":"Why this is just a beginning: a guide for The GME Gang newcomers and a quick recap of the situation","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T15:29:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 15:29","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lgpwez","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgpwez/why_this_is_just_a_beginning_a_guide_for_the_gme/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgpwez/why_this_is_just_a_beginning_a_guide_for_the_gme/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/HPFj-4e58iBj8u1W1afPnQHUE9-BDfX1pQMMOsQ9tyw.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=72179f9d0c63e09dc2abd1c7b9c9a7f7c4431e78","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"eblozavr322","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/eblozavr322","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"eblozavr322","score":9377,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么这只是一个开始：《GME帮》新人指南，快速总结情况","the_new_excerpt":"听好了，你们这些混蛋，对你们大多数人来说，这是你的第一次圈地，所以让我告诉你。\n这整个事情是如何工作的。你们中的一些人可能还记得我让你们跳的时候。\n在这个tendie火车在9美元时MSFT交易... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼這只是一個開始：《GME幫》新人指南，快速總結情況","the_new_excerpt":"聽好了，你們這些混蛋，對你們大多數人來說，這是你的第一次圈地，所以讓我告訴你。\n這整個事情是如何工作的。你們中的一些人可能還記得我讓你們跳的時候。\n在這個tendie火車在9美元時MSFT交易... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lrfxf3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrfxf3/a_m_c_yolo_update_feb_24_2021/","title":"A M C Yolo Update — Feb 24, 2021","date":"February 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"A M C Yolo更新--2021年2月24日。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"A M C Yolo更新--2021年2月24日。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1364683328113238019","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1364683328113238019","title":"GameStop stock doubled today. \n\nWhy?\n\nIt's 2021 - does it really matter?\n\n$GME https://t.co/U0m2cplpGR","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 24, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"今天GameStop的股票翻了一番。\n\n为什么呢？\n\n现在是2021年--这真的很重要吗？\n\n$GME https://t.co/U0m2cplpGR","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"今天GameStop的股票翻了一番。\n\n爲什麼呢？\n\n現在是2021年--這真的很重要嗎？\n\n$GME https://t.co/U0m2cplpGR","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lgpwez","previousId":"RedditPost-lrfxf3","nextId":"TweetPost-1364683328113238019","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgpwez/why_this_is_just_a_beginning_a_guide_for_the_gme/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
