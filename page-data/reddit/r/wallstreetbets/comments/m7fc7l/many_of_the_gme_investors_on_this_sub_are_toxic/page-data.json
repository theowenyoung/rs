I’m so tired of reading through the incredible DDs in this sub only to arrive at the comment section where some smooth brained dolt wrote, “not GME, downvote” or some bullshit like that. There’s already a GME subreddit and a daily mega thread to try to keep you people from running this sub into the ground.</p>\n\n<p>So if you’re worried that your 5 shares @220 might not actually turn into 100k, make a Twitter account and start shilling GameStop there. I am aware that the GameStop play is still happening and don’t need the opinion of a 16 year old whose mommy still direct deposits money in their bank account every week. </p>\n\n<p>Let me read and plagiarize the DDs written by the real autists in peace. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: mods get that pee martini ready for me, shaken not stirred. If you disagree with me get fucked. This is my post and karma only goes up 🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: A big thank you to the mods as they have delivered the nectar of the bulls. It goes down smooth, like GME shill’s brains. Good luck to everyone with money in the market tomorrow and GME to 1,000,000🦍🦍🦍</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: I want to reiterate that I’m not all hot and bothered by the volume of GME posts. It’s the ninnies that go into posts regarding other topics and fuck about. They’re like jehovas witnesses who knock on the door of honest, hardworking, American DDs and try to convert them. In a few years they’ll teach classes about GME, but for now let me read about other autistic shit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7fc7l/many_of_the_gme_investors_on_this_sub_are_toxic/","title":"Many of the GME investors on this sub are toxic and need to get their acts together","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T03:26:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 03:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m7fc7l","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7fc7l/many_of_the_gme_investors_on_this_sub_are_toxic/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7fc7l/many_of_the_gme_investors_on_this_sub_are_toxic/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"JackTuz","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JackTuz","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"JackTuz","score":22394,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"这个子上的很多GME投资者都是有毒的，需要振作起来。","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR：如果你是一个人，评论在DDs的股票是不是GME的股票\n或正在分散人们对GME的注意力，你是那种坏的弱智。\n\n发生在GameStop身上的事情过去和现在都是不可思议的，但这并不是一个。\nGameStop子网。我已经厌倦了阅读通过不可思议的DDs在... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這個子上的很多GME投資者都是有毒的，需要振作起來。","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR：如果你是一個人，評論在DDs的股票是不是GME的股票\n或正在分散人們對GME的注意力，你是那種壞的弱智。\n\n發生在GameStop身上的事情過去和現在都是不可思議的，但這並不是一個。\nGameStop子網。我已經厭倦了閱讀通過不可思議的DDs在... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1380231232634695682","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1380231232634695682","title":"The UK has now vaccinated (with at least 1 dose) 47% of their population.\n\nNew covid-19 cases are down 95% from their January high and deaths are down 98%. https://t.co/DK04LvFd0X","date":"April 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"英国では、全人口の47％にワクチンを接種（最低1回）しました。\n\nコビド19の新規感染者数は1月の最高値から95％減少し、死亡者数は98％減少した。https://t.co/DK04LvFd0X","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"英国现在已经为47%的人口接种了疫苗（至少1剂）。\n\n新的covid-19病例比1月份的最高值下降了95%，死亡人数下降了98%。https://t.co/DK04LvFd0X。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"英國現在已經爲47%的人口接種了疫苗（至少1劑）。\n\n新的covid-19病例比1月份的最高值下降了95%，死亡人數下降了98%。https://t.co/DK04LvFd0X。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mmvoyw","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmvoyw/gamestop_proxy_statement_should_come_out_today/","title":"GameStop Proxy Statement should come out today!!
