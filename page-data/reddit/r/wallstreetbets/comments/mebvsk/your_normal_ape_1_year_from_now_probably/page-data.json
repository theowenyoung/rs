I feel that most of the people investing in GME and AMC are normal down-to-earth people( i mean apes) and would not like to have the showoff kind of status but would like to make some dreams came true and have somehow a comfortable life. You would see them in some Mazdas, Honda&#39;s, Fords, Teslas model 3, etc. But the thing is that they would have the premium version with the best engine and all.</li>\n<li>He is debt-free, he won&#39;t talk about it but you won&#39;t hear him complaining about any student loans, car payments he has to do or anything.</li>\n<li>He does not work at that place you knew he was working before. So what&#39;s he doing? &quot;Wait, you quit your job? But it was a stable one and it&#39;s getting even harder to find jobs right now&quot;. &quot; Yeah, I took up *- insert interesting hobby/dream job/artistic activity/starting a business-*, I kind of felt it was the right direction for me, I m doing well right now, I don&#39;t think I will give it up to soon&quot;.</li>\n<li>He&#39;s in college, maybe, or taking some classes to do a career reconversion. Who knew she/he had an attraction for that domain right?</li>\n<li>He spends way more time with family. It&#39;s like he&#39;s always having time to spend with his girlfriend/kids/parents/friend. But he was working 50 hours a week. How does he have time to go on vacations every other week or so, taking kids to the park and all of that? Is he working from home and got a new position at the firm?</li>\n<li>He&#39;s not so active on social media. He&#39;s doing all sorts of things but does not fiend the need to get approval from others by posting share locations or pictures from where he&#39;s going or what he&#39;s doing. Only once in a while, you get a picture with him in a nice place but that&#39;s it.</li>\n<li>Way healthier. &quot;Hey did you start going to the gym? Yeah, had taken swimming and hiking also, I feel very good since then&quot;.</li>\n<li>Stopped drinking/smoking so much or being in a kind of bad mood most of the time. He does not have to do 3 night shifts per week anymore, right?</li>\n<li>Have a nice feeling all around. These people(apes) would start doing charity more, even the ones with more effort, like planting trees, going to the local homeless shelter(which also got build in the last 6 mounts) to help with cooking food for the people in need, helping with cleaning the garbage thrown away by people who last name is also garbage.</li>\n<li>Last of all, you kind of heard that more than 6 or 9 months ago he had a wild 2 weeks, like traveling half the country, doing some weird things, spending a lot of money, driving some luxury cars, but it&#39;s just some rumors, you don&#39;t know for sure. Also, why does he always wear those Monkey&#39;s Business t-shirts all the time, hmm?</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mebvsk/your_normal_ape_1_year_from_now_probably/","title":"Your normal ape 1 year from now... probably","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-27T16:00:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-27 16:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mebvsk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mebvsk/your_normal_ape_1_year_from_now_probably/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mebvsk/your_normal_ape_1_year_from_now_probably/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"nicolaespan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/nicolaespan","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"nicolaespan","score":1653,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"一年后，你的正常猿人... ...可能是。","the_new_excerpt":" 1.  他开的是顶级的 \"普通车\"。我觉得大部分投资的人\n     在GME和AMC中，他们都是正常的平凡人（我指的是猿人），不会有这样的想法。\n     喜欢有炫耀的状态，但想做一些梦想。\n     梦想成真，过上了舒适的生活。你...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一年後，你的正常猿人... ...可能是。","the_new_excerpt":" 1.  他開的是頂級的 \"普通車\"。我覺得大部分投資的人\n     在GME和AMC中，他們都是正常的平凡人（我指的是猿人），不會有這樣的想法。\n     喜歡有炫耀的狀態，但想做一些夢想。\n     夢想成真，過上了舒適的生活。你...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mx27u0","excerpt":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal\nHey all,\n\n2 months ago I made a terminal that I had been working on my spare time, to help\nme on my stock research, open-source.\n\nThe motto:\nGamestonk Terminal provides a modern Python-based integrated environment for\ninvestment research, that allows…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mx27u0/move_over_bloomberg_terminal_here_comes_gamestonk/","title":"Move over Bloomberg Terminal, here comes Gamestonk Terminal","date":"April 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Bloomberg Terminalの次は、Gamestonk Terminalです。","the_new_excerpt":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal\n皆さん、こんにちは。\n\n2ヶ月前、私は自分の株の研究を助けるために、空き時間に作業していた端末をオープンソースにしました。\nオープンソースにしました。\n\nモットーは\nGamestonk Terminalは、Pythonベースのモダンな投資研究用統合環境を提供します。\n投資調査のための近代的な統合環境を提供します...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"挪开彭博终端，来了Gamestonk终端","the_new_excerpt":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal\n大家好。\n\n两个月前，我做了一个终端，我一直在利用业余时间工作，以帮助我的股票研究。\n我的股票研究，开源的。\n\n的口号。\nGamestonk终端提供了一个基于Python的现代集成环境，用于\n投资研究，它允许...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"挪開彭博終端，來了Gamestonk終端","the_new_excerpt":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal\n大家好。\n\n兩個月前，我做了一個終端，我一直在利用業餘時間工作，以幫助我的股票研究。\n我的股票研究，開源的。\n\n的口號。\nGamestonk終端提供了一個基於Python的現代集成環境，用於\n投資研究，它允許...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mx0qvn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mx0qvn/cofounder_of_hedge_fund_charged_with_40_million/","title":"Co-Founder Of Hedge Fund Charged With $40 Million Securities Fraud Scheme | USAO-SDNY","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 23, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ヘッジファンドの共同創業者、4000万ドルの証券詐欺スキームで起訴｜USAO-SDNY","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"对冲基金的联合创始人被指控实施4000万美元的证券欺诈计划 | USAO-SDNY","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"對沖基金的聯合創始人被指控實施4000萬美元的證券欺詐計劃 | USAO-SDNY","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mebvsk","previousId":"RedditPost-mx27u0","nextId":"RedditPost-mx0qvn","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mebvsk/your_normal_ape_1_year_from_now_probably/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
