That&#39;s all it took for the hedgies to beat you into submission, you weak-ass paper-handed bitch. And they knew it, too. They&#39;re laughing all the way to $5 knowing everyone will lose interest. I&#39;m sure they weren&#39;t even expecting 3 fuckkng days. I&#39;m sure they were at least expecting us to last a week.  </p>\n\n<p>So STFU and hold your fucking shares. It&#39;s that fucking easy. Turn off your phone, block access to your brokerage, whatever the fuck, just hold.  </p>\n\n<p>140 shares and buying more at open. Holding like my wife&#39;s boyfriend holds her sweet ass. So that one day I can be her boyfriend too.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: you&#39;re a fucking pussy. Hold your shares and buy the dip.  </p>\n\n<p>ETA: I love this fucking stonk.
