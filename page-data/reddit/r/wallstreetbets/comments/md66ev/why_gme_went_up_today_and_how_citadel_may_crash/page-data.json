The buying and selling of securities in different markets or forms in order to take advantage of the differing prices of the same asset.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arbitrage Analogy:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Think of ETFs like XRT as a fruit basket, and the stocks they contain fruits. Say the XRT fruit basket was $6 and contained a banana (GME), orange, and apple. And individual bananas are $1, oranges are $2, and apples are $3.  The total cost of buying the fruits individually is the NAV (net asset value) which in this case is also $6. Citadel can make their own fruit baskets by buying individual fruits but they wouldn’t make too much money since the price of the fruit basket are usually similar to the NAV. In recent years Citadel and other APs have found a much more profitable strategy – Operational Shorting.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xbgahbnu38p61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2a85ef438ab5b7535f10e981b6787f5ffea2a40\">https://preview.redd.it/xbgahbnu38p61.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2a85ef438ab5b7535f10e981b6787f5ffea2a40</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Operational Shorting Analogy:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Citadel has the ability to NAKED SELL nonexistent fruit baskets (XRT / IWM) at $6 but not deliver on them until 6 days later. Flooding the market with tons of promised fruit baskets can drive down the price of individual fruits (bananas went from $1 -&gt; $0.5, oranges to $1.8, apples to $2.7), only to buy back the individual fruits 6 days later at a CHEAPER NAV and deliver those fruit baskets to you. That fruit basket that was delivered to buyers only cost Citadel (0.5 + 1.8 + 2.7 = $5) to make, netting them a cool $1 while also driving down the price of bananas by 50%.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Operational Shorting by Citadel</h1>\n\n<p>When faced with “excess buying” pressure for ETF shares, <strong>the AP/MM can sell shares “naked” and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for “bona fide” market making)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Market makers, often commercial banks or hedge funds, create ETFs for their issuers by buying the securities that the funds are supposed to represent. <strong><em>But they&#39;ve discovered that they can make a predictable return by delaying the purchases and selling you nonexistent exchange-traded fund shares that they will create later</em></strong>. These transactions are a form of shorting – Operational Shorting as coined by Richard Evans, Professor at the Darden School of Business.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Okay.. What does this mean for GME?</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Citadel is willing to NAKED SHORT ANY ETF containing GME</strong>, and by extension the <strong>ENTIRE MARKET</strong> (will show later) to drive down the price of GME. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fmcvf8th58p61.png?width=1645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0aaf95f29be4cd34b050883f8f3efefec40e2c8\">https://preview.redd.it/fmcvf8th58p61.png?width=1645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0aaf95f29be4cd34b050883f8f3efefec40e2c8</a></p>\n\n<h1>If Citadel Shorted ETFs to Drive Down GME Price, Why Did It Go Up Today?</h1>\n\n<p>SEC Rules that Citadel must deliver on naked ETF shorts by T+6 by buying back the underlying shares.

When we examine the impact of FTDs across different ETFs, <strong>we find evidence consistent with this contagion-like effect</strong>. Moreover, we also find that <strong>APs that are closer to their maximum regulatory leverage limit are more likely to operationally short</strong>. These results suggest ETF trading relies on an inter-connected network of liquidity providers which, at times, pursue positively correlated <strong>trading strategies that can be detrimental to the overall market.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Findings on Operational Shorting and Financial Linkages</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>APs who are operationally short in one ETF, are more likely to be operationally short in other ETFs for which they serve as an AP (intra-AP linkage)\n\n<ul>\n<li>Proof in point: Citadel began shorting XRT to drive down the price of GME in Feb, and more recently have shorted IWM to drive down the price of GME again</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>A given AP has higher operational shorting when other APs have higher levels of operational shorting (inter-AP linkage)\n\n<ul>\n<li>Higher operational shorting by Citadel linked to higher operational shorting by other APs</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Looking at regulatory constraints on AP leverage, <strong>we also find that the closer a firm is to its regulatory leverage limit, the higher levels of operational shorting.</strong> <strong>This is consistent with a contagion-like effect that could cause entire market instability.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>CITADEL AND FRIENDS FUCKED AND ON THE BRINK.</h1>\n\n<h1>UPTICK IN RECENT ETF NAKED SHORTING SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE CLOSER TO THEIR REGULATORY LEVERAGE LIMITS.</h1>\n\n<h1>EXPECT MORE NAKED SHORTING OF ETFS BUT THESE ADDITIONAL SHORTING MAY LEAD TO ENTIRE MARKET INSTABILITY</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Evans, Richard B. and Moussawi, Rabih and Pagano, Michael S. and Sedunov, John, ETF Short Interest and Failures-to-Deliver: Naked Short-Selling or Operational Shorting?
