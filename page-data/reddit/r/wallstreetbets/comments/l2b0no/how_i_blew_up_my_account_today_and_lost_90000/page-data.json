I started in 2017 with like 30k of my own money and over the course of 3 years, spent probably a couple hundred hours learning about stocks, options, doing &quot;research&quot; etc. Today, I am down 8k since i started in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Proof: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/8zoihg7\">https://imgur.com/8zoihg7</a></p>\n\n<p>(shows -60k but I was down -30k yesterday already on the calls)</p>\n\n<p>That was money I planned on using for a downpayment on a house, and for paying my taxes on gains from last year. So once February comes around, the 20k I have left is basically going to taxes on gains from last year which are now gone. I am effectively broke :-)</p>\n\n<p>Im not that upset because I have a decent paying job.. but god damn, I was literally just contacting real estate agents last week because I was planning on buying a house. I could still buy one, but it will probably take me years to get back to 100k in savings.</p>\n\n<p>I should have just stuck to selling puts like I was doing for the past couple months. The gains aren&#39;t huge, but selling 100k worth of puts every week is enough to make you a couple G&#39;s every month with not a ton of risk. I could have made my future mortgage payments just selling puts.</p>\n\n<p>I am trying to look on the bright side. Having 100k made me spend somewhat frivolously. Like eating out twice a day, buying clothes i didn&#39;t need, etc. Now I have to go back to scrimping and scraping, which is good I think. I was getting a little ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I have been finishing up my degree online but have had no motivation since I already have a decent job and decent money saved. Im feeling the pressure now to hurry up and finish my degree so I can get a better job (100k+ a year).</p>\n\n<p>I went all in on $390 1/22 SPY calls yesterday. I did the math; if we would have had a 1.5% day today, I would have made about 500k.. but it was pretty flat so at open, I was already down a shit ton. Figuring there was no chance left, I pulled out what was left, about 47k. I saw ford was going up crazy and figured that was pretty much my only chance to get back to where I was. Basically bought calls expiring tomorrow at the top, started going down, I pushed out and sold. So now I have 20k.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not super depressed about it or anything because I know ill be fine, but I already miss the coziness of having 100k stored away. Knowing that if I lost my job or something, id be okay. But like I said, Im looking on the bright side.</p>\n\n<p>My goal at the moment is to just save as much money as possible, pay my taxes in February, and then start over.\nNot even gonna lie, if I didn&#39;t need the 20k to pay taxes on last years gains, Id probably yolo it into something crazy. It&#39;s better to feel like this than nothing at all. Kinda fucked but whatever man, life is just boring.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong> Honestly guys, I could go all in GME shares but even if it goes up 100% this year, I will only be at 40k.. which is already far fetched. Do any of you seriously believe GME is going up 500% this year? Maybe. Maybe you&#39;re right.. Maybe I need to go all in shares, defer paying my taxes for as long as possible, and hope for the best. God you guys give me hope.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>EDIT 2</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>ALRIGHT, so im going all in shares on something and just holding long. Half of you faggies are saying GME, half are saying BB. Which fucking one is it? I can&#39;t risk any options plays at the moment</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>EDIT: Went all in GME this morning, already up 50% to 30k. There is hope!</em></strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2b0no/how_i_blew_up_my_account_today_and_lost_90000/","title":"How I Blew Up My Account Today and Lost $90,000","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-22T22:16:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-22 22:16","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l2b0no","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2b0no/how_i_blew_up_my_account_today_and_lost_90000/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2b0no/how_i_blew_up_my_account_today_and_lost_90000/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/GbsoI9PIEBMOoX4aIBKJAr8PnUXtkuCm4JDjd8WO6hw.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=59d082ed44255997e18c4526f058217e8bf865f9","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"FreakingOutTheNGHBRD","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/FreakingOutTheNGHBRD","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"FreakingOutTheNGHBRD","score":1682,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"今天我是如何炸掉自己的账户，损失9万元的？","the_new_excerpt":"好了各位，我今天在SPY看涨上亏了9万，基本上是我账户的全部资金。\n我从2017年开始，用自己的钱大概有3万，在3年的时间里。\n花了大概几百个小时学习股票，期权，做\n\"研究 \"等。今天，我下降了8千，因为我开始在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天我是如何炸掉自己的賬戶，損失9萬元的？","the_new_excerpt":"好了各位，我今天在SPY看漲上虧了9萬，基本上是我賬戶的全部資金。\n我從2017年開始，用自己的錢大概有3萬，在3年的時間裏。\n花了大概幾百個小時學習股票，期權，做\n\"研究 \"等。今天，我下降了8千，因爲我開始在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lb7a2t","excerpt":"I lost 3k usd last thursday when the brokers restricted trading (3k usd might\nnot be much for you but I live in Mexico), all I've been thinking this time is\nto make that money back, and today I made a terrible decision and I bet\neverything I had on gme when it was around $135 and going up fast, it…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lb7a2t/gme_ruined_me_financially/","title":"GME ruined me financially","date":"February 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME毁了我的财务","the_new_excerpt":"上周四，当经纪商限制交易时，我损失了3千美元（3千美元可能会影响到我的生活）。\n对你来说不算什么，但我住在墨西哥），这段时间我一直在想的就是\n赚回这笔钱，今天我做了一个可怕的决定，我赌了\n我在gme上的一切，当它是135美元左右，并迅速上升，它... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME毀了我的財務","the_new_excerpt":"上週四，當經紀商限制交易時，我損失了3千美元（3千美元可能會影響到我的生活）。\n對你來說不算什麼，但我住在墨西哥），這段時間我一直在想的就是\n賺回這筆錢，今天我做了一個可怕的決定，我賭了\n我在gme上的一切，當它是135美元左右，並迅速上升，它... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1356820905847099392","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1356820905847099392","title":"The combined annual revenue of the 4 largest US companies has surpassed $1 trillion for the first time...\nApple $AAPL: $294 billion\nMicrosoft $MSFT: $153 billion\nAmazon $AMZN: $386 billion\nGoogle $GOOGL: $183 billion\n\nThat's larger than the GDP of all but 16 countries.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 03, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国4大公司的年收入总和首次突破1万亿美元......\n苹果公司$AAPL：2940亿美元\n微软$MSFT：1530亿美元\n亚马逊$AMZN：3860亿美元\n谷歌$GOOGL：1830亿美元\n\n这比除16个国家以外的所有国家的GDP都要大。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國4大公司的年收入總和首次突破1萬億美元......\n蘋果公司$AAPL：2940億美元\n微軟$MSFT：1530億美元\n亞馬遜$AMZN：3860億美元\n谷歌$GOOGL：1830億美元\n\n這比除16個國家以外的所有國家的GDP都要大。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l2b0no","previousId":"RedditPost-lb7a2t","nextId":"TweetPost-1356820905847099392","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2b0no/how_i_blew_up_my_account_today_and_lost_90000/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
