If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book <a href=\"https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle\">here</a>. But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I&#39;m going to summarise it quickly.</p>\n\n<p>A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot&#39;s early days.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, our fellow 🦍 Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called &quot;waves&quot;.Simplified there are only two types of waves:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Impulse</li>\n<li>Corrective</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Impulsive Waves</strong></p>\n\n<p>Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7zcxlzn7ohn61.png?width=535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c7d5d431d351b8011ef4a5b4fa4fb123b4ee064\">https://preview.redd.it/7zcxlzn7ohn61.png?width=535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c7d5d431d351b8011ef4a5b4fa4fb123b4ee064</a></p>\n\n<p>Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart</p>\n\n<p><strong>Corrective Waves</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that&#39;s the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bf1arfybohn61.png?width=382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7503b533893b2ab4b05ddc4ac04df20675939cf\">https://preview.redd.it/bf1arfybohn61.png?width=382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7503b533893b2ab4b05ddc4ac04df20675939cf</a></p>\n\n<p>Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart</p>\n\n<p><em>There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.</em></p>\n\n<p>Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mindblowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. 🤯 I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you&#39;d be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.</li>\n<li>Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. <em>(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So you are telling me that fellow 🦍 Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...</p>\n\n<p>Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike most indicators it doesn&#39;t lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.</p>\n\n<p>Already during our first 🚀 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ktfxk4aeohn61.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaadea58e519cfb08c76a483298b9d56e83ad4bb\">https://preview.redd.it/ktfxk4aeohn61.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaadea58e519cfb08c76a483298b9d56e83ad4bb</a></p>\n\n<p>Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January </p>\n\n<p>I shared that screenshot initially <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/\">here</a> and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our 🚀 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3iokow4gohn61.png?width=1552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d721faa86a85d269ba2f45abd2ac9194b467f6ec\">https://preview.redd.it/3iokow4gohn61.png?width=1552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d721faa86a85d269ba2f45abd2ac9194b467f6ec</a></p>\n\n<p>What actually happened after that &quot;prediction&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our 🚀 take-off was canceled.</p>\n\n<p>If you can follow so far that&#39;s great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.</p>\n\n<p>OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?</p>\n\n<p>Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.</p>\n\n<p>However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I&#39;m still going to share them.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q26p6lmkohn61.png?width=1782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50290f8fe34fb0e2cd1fb6f58c8c06fc81a6b67f\">https://preview.redd.it/q26p6lmkohn61.png?width=1782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50290f8fe34fb0e2cd1fb6f58c8c06fc81a6b67f</a></p>\n\n<p>Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.</p>\n\n<p>The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven&#39;t reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won&#39;t, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that&#39;s still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vpssstgmohn61.png?width=1854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a82de9fedbea728b56c48befb504dfbb90ee00b\">https://preview.redd.it/vpssstgmohn61.png?width=1854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a82de9fedbea728b56c48befb504dfbb90ee00b</a></p>\n\n<p>🚀 Pre-Launch</p>\n\n<p>Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we&#39;d see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few 📄 🙌 bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.</p>\n\n<p>However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impuls that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our 🚀 fly. It&#39;s hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we&#39;ll see a small retracement and then we&#39;ll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the 🚀 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6okds/gme_is_just_getting_started/","title":"GME is just getting started!!!","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T18:29:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 18:29","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m6okds","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6okds/gme_is_just_getting_started/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6okds/gme_is_just_getting_started/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/tb3qWosR4nZ838LBpIdFHMfjkBl9VOkb59AqgRkvLJM.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a4c36d86333c54d67bcfb0b30a857dba34ac1a98","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"saliym1988","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/saliym1988","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"saliym1988","score":3009,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME才刚刚开始!!!","the_new_excerpt":"向u/ChristianRauchenwald[/u/ChristianRauchenwald]喊话，向世界喊话。\n类DD!\n\n\n\n艾略特波理论\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0vdexj5ohn61.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=41320130f91b5347a393774aedaf563a91b461a1\n\n埃利奥特波为GME - 这意味着什么，进一步下文... ...\n\n我知道大多数...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME纔剛剛開始!!!","the_new_excerpt":"向u/ChristianRauchenwald[/u/ChristianRauchenwald]喊話，向世界喊話。\n類DD!\n\n\n\n艾略特波理論\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0vdexj5ohn61.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=41320130f91b5347a393774aedaf563a91b461a1\n\n埃利奧特波爲GME - 這意味着什麼，進一步下文... ...\n\n我知道大多數...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mm6n82","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mm6n82/proof_my_700_gme_shares_balls_deep_lets_take_gme/","title":"Proof my 700 GME shares, balls deep!!
