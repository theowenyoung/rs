BB has potential to moon, but I think a lot of you will still manage to lose money, because you are picking wrong strategies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>\n\n<p>I know this sub is obsessed with short term OTM calls. However by buying these you are doing no justice to yourself and this community.</p>\n\n<p>Let me explain. Have you ever wondered who sells you these calls? I&#39;ll tell you. Big guys and by big guys I&#39;m talking billion dollar financial institutions that we call <strong>market makers</strong>. Market maker does not care which stock, what strike, how many 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 we put here - all they care about is to <strong>make money by selling you calls.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Market makers are very good at managing risk. Whenever they sell calls, they make sure they have the underlying stock. That way, they essentially sell <strong>covered calls</strong> instead of <strong>naked calls</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>When you look at the option table, you will notice a column called <strong>Open Interest</strong>. It basically tells you have many option contracts are out there in the wild. Think about this as a number of retards holding these in their Robinhood account, hoping to get rich quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Market makers love when there is a big hype around certain stock, especially certain strike and date. They sell these calls to you retards, and all they have to do as the expiration date nears is make sure <strong>the stock stays below the most popular strike</strong>, aka <strong>strike with the most open interest</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Why would they do that? Because they <strong>make free money</strong> by selling you these worthless gambling short term tickets.</p>\n\n<p>How would they do this? By shorting the stock. Remember they are so big that they can afford to short the stock and suppress the price of the stock <strong>in the short term</strong> just in time for <strong>your short term calls to expire worthless</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I know some of you geniuses will tell me that market makers can&#39;t manipulate the stock in the short term; sure keep telling yourself that while you ride in your 2010 Toyota Corolla.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You are easy targets</strong></p>\n\n<p>Over 11,000 of you idiots, bought $12 February calls. Don&#39;t believe me? Check it yourself: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1\">https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1</a></p>\n\n<p>All market makers have to do now, is make sure BB does not moon past $12 by February 19 and they are set. You lost your stimulus check money and have no means to play again.</p>\n\n<p>March is even worse: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1\">https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1</a>. All of you piling into $15 strikes. Why are you making yourself easy targets? You are disclosing your strike and your date! What if BB moons in April? Can you sustain wasting money on these monthly calls with your minimum wage jobs?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The solution</strong></p>\n\n<p>Buy shares. They do not expire. There is no pressure to be right. You want to be on the 🚀 when it starts taking off, instead of being broke on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>With worthless calls, no one will like you - even this sub will make funny of you.</p>\n\n<p>Believe me. I&#39;ve been here long enough to remember MSFT 03/21/2020 C $200 and PLTR 12/31/2020 C $30.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br/>\nBuy BB shares, not short term OTM calls.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzon9z/dont_buy_bb_calls_buy_bb_shares_heres_why/","title":"Don't buy $BB calls, buy $BB shares - Here's why","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-18T19:38:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-18 19:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kzon9z","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzon9z/dont_buy_bb_calls_buy_bb_shares_heres_why/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzon9z/dont_buy_bb_calls_buy_bb_shares_heres_why/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"SilbergleitJunior","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SilbergleitJunior","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"SilbergleitJunior","score":1370,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"不要买巴恩斯B的看涨，买巴恩斯B的股票--这是为什么？","the_new_excerpt":"我承认 所有这一切黑莓泵让我兴奋，我想得到一些\n行动了。BB有潜力的月球，但我想你们很多人还是会管理的\n赔钱，因为你选择了错误的策略。\n\n问题是\n\n我知道这个子迷恋短线的OTM电话。然而通过买...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不要買巴恩斯B的看漲，買巴恩斯B的股票--這是爲什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"我承認 所有這一切黑莓泵讓我興奮，我想得到一些\n行動了。BB有潛力的月球，但我想你們很多人還是會管理的\n賠錢，因爲你選擇了錯誤的策略。\n\n問題是\n\n我知道這個子迷戀短線的OTM電話。然而通過買...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l8owl1","excerpt":"Facebook Inc. will suffer damage to its core business when Apple Inc. implements\nnew privacy changes, advertising industry experts say, as it becomes harder for\nthe social-media company to gather user data and prove that ads on its platform\nwork.\n\nFacebook warned this week that Apple’s new feature,…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l8owl1/apples_privacy_change_will_hit_facebooks_core_ad/","title":"Apple’s Privacy Change Will Hit Facebook’s Core Ad Business.
