He has apparently got a little lucky on $TSLA lately and made some good money for a 15 year old, (I&#39;m assuming he is using his parents&#39; outside account).</p>\n\n<p>As soon as I got on the phone with him, I noticed an air of superiority. After discussing his &quot;investment strategy&quot; with him for a moment he started to tell me he knows more about investing than I ever will. Keep in mind he says he has been &quot;investing&quot; for 2 months. Then he hit me with this quote, which I will never forget in my entire life:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Long term investments are for pussies. I dont want to drive a ferrari when I&#39;m 60 if I could when I&#39;m 16&quot;</p>\n\n<p>You people are creating an entire generation of autists. Godspeed.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>edit: DISCLAIMER ON USE OF TERM &quot;AUTIST&quot;: this post hit <a href=\"/r/all\">r/all</a>, which I never expected it to, and now I am getting flamed for using the term autist.</p>\n\n<p>For people who are here from <a href=\"/r/all\">r/all</a>, you will see that terms like this are used frequently and endearingly on this sub. I do genuinely apologize if I have offended anybody, though. It was not my intention.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kv9k3n/you_people_are_creating_autists/","title":"You people are creating autists.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-11T21:36:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-11 21:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kv9k3n","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kv9k3n/you_people_are_creating_autists/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kv9k3n/you_people_are_creating_autists/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"FinAdvisor92","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/FinAdvisor92","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"FinAdvisor92","score":15165,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你们这些人在制造自闭症患者。","the_new_excerpt":"今天早上我和一位客户谈话，他问我是否愿意\n与他15岁的儿子交谈并回答一些问题\n从他的财务状况来看，给他指个正确的方向。他显然得了\n最近在美国电话服务级别协议上有点走运，15年的…赚了不少钱","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們這些人在製造自閉症患者。","the_new_excerpt":"今天早上我和一位客戶談話，他問我是否願意\n與他15歲的兒子交談並回答一些問題\n從他的財務狀況來看，給他指個正確的方向。他顯然得了\n最近在美國電話服務級別協議上有點走運，15年的…賺了不少錢","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l6a8fn","excerpt":"A pretty good segment with Chamath Palihapitiya who apparently took a $100k call\nposition in GME \"to learn\".\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354089928313823232\n\n\n\nThe bottom line was that Chamath was pushing the point that Hedge funds have had\nthe advantage until now, but with social media…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l6a8fn/chamath_palihapitiya_was_just_on_cnbc_trying_to/","title":"Chamath Palihapitiya was just on CNBC trying to explain our current situation","date":"January 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Chamath Palihapitiya刚刚在CNBC上试图解释我们目前的情况。","the_new_excerpt":"一个相当不错的段子与Chamath Palihapitiya谁显然采取了10万美元的电话。\n在金隅 \"学习 \"的立场。\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354089928313823232\n\n\n\n最重要的是，查马思推崇的是对冲基金有\n的优势，直到现在，但与社交媒体... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Chamath Palihapitiya剛剛在CNBC上試圖解釋我們目前的情況。","the_new_excerpt":"一個相當不錯的段子與Chamath Palihapitiya誰顯然採取了10萬美元的電話。\n在金隅 \"學習 \"的立場。\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354089928313823232\n\n\n\n最重要的是，查馬思推崇的是對沖基金有\n的優勢，直到現在，但與社交媒體... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l67hla","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l67hla/bought_at_the_top_to_encourage_you_retards_to_not/","title":"Bought at the top to encourage you retards to not give up","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 27, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"买在上面是为了鼓励你们这些弱智不要放弃。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"買在上面是爲了鼓勵你們這些弱智不要放棄。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kv9k3n","previousId":"RedditPost-l6a8fn","nextId":"RedditPost-l67hla","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kv9k3n/you_people_are_creating_autists/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
