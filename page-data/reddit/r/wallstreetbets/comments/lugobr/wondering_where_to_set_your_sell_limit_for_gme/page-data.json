Go take a look. <em>EVERYBODY!</em></p>\n\n<p>I’ve pulled numbers from the chart, I know they don’t line up with the values from 2008 (stock split maybe?) but they are accurate when used relative to one another.</p>\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n<p>October 2nd: $263</p>\n\n<p>October 3rd: $277</p>\n\n<p>October 6th: $292</p>\n\n<p>October 7th: $287</p>\n\n<p>October 8th: $294</p>\n\n<p>October 9th: $296</p>\n\n<p>October 10th: $342</p>\n\n<p>October 13th: $353</p>\n\n<p>October 14th: $352</p>\n\n<p>October 15th: $390</p>\n\n<p>October 16th: $398 (High $428, Low $382) --&gt; <strong>NOT THE SQUEEZE</strong></p>\n\n<p>October 17th: $358</p>\n\n<p>October 20th: $277</p>\n\n<p>October 21st: $242</p>\n\n<p>October 22nd: $243</p>\n\n<p>October 23rd: $229</p>\n\n<p>October 24th: $210</p>\n\n<p>October 27th: $520 (High $635, Low $324) --&gt; <strong>SQUEEZE</strong></p>\n\n<p>October 28th: $500 (High $500, Low $471) --&gt; <strong>SQUEEZE</strong></p>\n\n<p>October 29th: $517 (High $607, Low $491) --&gt; <strong>SQUEEZE</strong></p>\n\n<p>October 30th: $500 (High $590, Low $485) --&gt; <strong>SQUEEZE</strong></p>\n\n<p>October 31st: $499 (High $548, Low $472) --&gt; <strong>SQUEEZE</strong></p>\n\n<p>The stock then trades around $400 for almost another 2 weeks before starting to make its way back down towards pre-squeeze levels.</p>\n\n<p><em>BEFORE THE SQUEEZE</em>, the price ramps up to a peak on October 16th of $428, before crashing down over the next 6 days back to a low of $210.85 on October 24th, at which point the squeeze squozes. Once squozen, it squozes for <strong>5 DAYS</strong>. If the price rises and crashes fast, it <em>wasn’t</em> the squeeze.</p>\n\n<p><em>Please!</em> Put away your fears that you are going to miss the squeeze. If we get to the true squeeze, you’ll have time to take a nap and still not miss it. Even if you went on vacation for a week perfectly around the Volkswagen squeeze, you’d still have almost 2 weeks to sell at ~80% of the squeeze average.</p>\n\n<p>Is 100k a meme? I have no idea - but it <em>doesn’t matter</em>. The BEST way for us to get the HIGHEST price is to completely delete your sell limits, and wait for the squeeze to squoze. That way we all get the best price, and we don’t risk scrubbing the launch before take off. In addition, the HFs can see your sell limits, and will use whatever information they can against us. Just delete them.</p>\n\n<p>Absolute worst case scenario is that you’re in a coma for the squeeze, and Papa Cohen drives you all the way to tendie town.</p>\n\n<p>Now, (looks around) where is that lurker shell I crawled out of.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: The train to tendie town doesn’t just fly by and force you to jump off a moving train. The train <strong>STOPS</strong> at tendie town for a vacation. The best way to get the highest price is to delete your sell limits and wait for the squeeze to squoze.</p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.
