Let&#39;s pretend it is currently trading at $9.28.</p>\n\n<h1>First, some terms you should know:</h1>\n\n<p>Option: a contract that gives you the OPTION to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price) on a certain date</p>\n\n<p>Premium: The per-share price paid to the option contract seller for the option</p>\n\n<p>Underlying: The stock on which we are trading options</p>\n\n<p>Long: Means that we are BUYING an option</p>\n\n<p>Short: Means that we are SELLING an option</p>\n\n<p>Call: An option contract that gives the LONG side the OPTION to BUY 100 shares of the underlying for a given strike price</p>\n\n<p>Put: An option contract that gives the LONG side the OPTION to SELL 100 shares of the underlying for a given strike price</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now, how can we make money with a small account balance?</p>\n\n<h1>If we have a BULLISH outlook (AMC goes to $13 because Stonks go up 📈📈📈)</h1>\n\n<h1>1. YOLO calls (maximum gains, maximum risk):</h1>\n\n<p>Buy an out-of-the-money (OTM) call for an expiration date and hope the gamble goes your way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A long $10C 3/26</strong> ($10 dollar strike call expiring on March 26) position trades for a premium of $1.49 a share, which gives us a total price of $149 per contract (100 shares at $1.49 per share).</p>\n\n<p>This contract is out of the money - meaning the strike price is above the current trading price.</p>\n\n<p>This is a straight up gamble. If AMC doesn&#39;t reach the strike price, the option expires worthless, because buying 100 shares at market price will be cheaper than exercising your right to buy 100 shares at the strike price. In that scenario, we have lost the premium we spent to buy the option.</p>\n\n<p>As $AMC’s market price approaches the strike price of $10, the option’s value will go up – meaning you could sell the option at a higher premium than you paid for it.</p>\n\n<p>However, we will still lose money on this trade if the price doesn’t go above $11.49. That can be calculated by adding our per-share premium to our strike price. Since we paid $1.49 per share for the contract at a $10 strike, we need to recoup the premium of $1.49 per share. Hence the breakeven stock price is $11.49.</p>\n\n<p>If AMC manages to hit $13, we’ll be able to exercise the option (and purchase 100 shares at 11.49 each) or sell the contract for the market rate of around $3.00 per share. If we exercise the option, we could immediately sell the 100 shares at market price of $13, earning us $13 - $11.49 = $1.51 per share, or $151 total.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Net investment and max risk: $149 per contract</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Breakeven price: $11.49 ($10 strike + $1.49 premium)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Net P/L at $13: +151 per contract ($3.00 – $1.49) x 100</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>2. Debit spread (limited gains, lower risk)</h1>\n\n<p>This option strategy is a two-tiered approach. In short, we open both a long and a short position at different strike prices.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s say we think AMC will go up to around $13 by 3/26.</p>\n\n<p>We can <strong>buy</strong>, or <strong>open a long $10c 3/26</strong> position, which trades for a premium of $1.49 per share ($149 per contract). This is out of the money.</p>\n\n<p>We then <strong>sell</strong> or <strong>open a</strong> <strong>short $12c 3/26</strong> position, which trades for a premium of $1.00 per share ($100 per contract). It’s also out of the money, but since we are selling it, we get the $100.</p>\n\n<p>Net-net, we spend $49 per contract here, which significantly reduces our risk profile and makes our break-even price much lower. Now let’s see what happens:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AMC @ 13</strong></p>\n\n<p>If AMC hits $13, both of our options are in the money. The $10c will be worth 3.00/share, and the $12c will be worth $1/share, which means when we close the options, we collect $300 and pay $100, giving us a gross profit of $200. If we subtract our initial cost of $49, we get a net profit of <strong>$151</strong>. Important to note that our profits are capped at $151/contract since we only have a spread of $2 between the strike prices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AMC @ 11</strong></p>\n\n<p>If AMC hits $11, only our long contract is in the money. The $10c will be worth $1.00/share, and the 12c will be worthless. This means we can close our options and pocket the difference, which is <strong>$51.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Net investment and max risk: $49 per contract</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Breakeven price: $10.49 ($10 strike + 0.49 net premium)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Net P/L at $13: +151 per contract ($3.00 – 1.00) x 100 – (0.49 x 100)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Net P/L at $10: +51 per contract ($1.00 – 0.00) x 100 – (0.49 x 100)</strong></p>\n\n<h1>If we have a BEARISH outlook (AMC goes to $6 because fuck AMC, all my homies hate AMC 📉📉📉)</h1>\n\n<h1>1. YOLO Puts (maximum gains, maximum risk)</h1>\n\n<p>A <strong>long 8P 3/26</strong> position trades for a premium of $1.05 per share, so $105 per contract.</p>\n\n<p>Like the YOLO call, this is a gamble, and if you don’t have a lot of equity in your account, it’s unwise unless you have a really good feeling, or it came to you in a dream.</p>\n\n<p>The same principle with breakeven prices applies here. Our 8p costs 1.05 a share, so for us to break even, the share price needs to reach $6.95 (8 – 1.05). To exercise this option, we would buy 100 shares of $AMC at market price of $6.95, then sell those shares to the sucker on the other end of our option for $8 per share.</p>\n\n<p>If the price doesn’t go below $8, our option expires worthless.</p>\n\n<p>If the price hits $5.50, we can exercise the option: Buy 100 shares of AMC at current market price ($5.50) and then sell them for $8 a share (our strike price). Alternatively, we can sell the option for the market price, which would be around $2.50, netting us $1.45 per share.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Net investment and max risk: $105 per contract</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Breakeven price: $6.95 ($8 strike – $1.05 premium)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Net P/L at $5.50: +145 per contract ($2.50 – $1.05) x 100</strong></p>\n\n<h1>2. Another debit spread (limited gains, low risk)</h1>\n\n<p>Again, we use the same approach with spreads as before.</p>\n\n<p>We can open the same <strong>long 8p 3/26</strong> position for 1.05/share, and simultaneously open a <strong>short 6p 3/26</strong> position for 0.33/share. That gives us a total cost of 0.72 per share, making our breakeven price 7.28 (8 - 0.72).</p>\n\n<p>The spread is the maximum potential gain per share. So even if AMC tanks and goes below $3-4 a share, our maximum profit potential doesn’t change after it drops past 6.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s see the math:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AMC @ 5.50</strong></p>\n\n<p>Both of our options are in the money. The 8p will be worth 2.50 per share, and 6p will be worth 0.50 a share. When we close the options, we collect $250 for selling the 8p, and pay $50 for closing the 6p, for gross earnings of $2.00 per share. If we subtract our buy-in of .72, we are left with 1.28 per share as our profit or <strong>$128</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AMC @ 7.00</strong></p>\n\n<p>Again, here only our long position is in the money. The 8P will be worth 1.00 per share, and the 6P is worthless. We can close the option out and pocket our difference of 0.28 per share, or <strong>$28.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Net investment and max risk: $72 per contract</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Breakeven price: $7.28 ($8 strike – 0.72 net premium)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Net P/L at $5.50: +128 per contract ($2.50 – 0.5) x 100 – (0.72 x 100)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Net P/L at $7.00: +28 per contract ($1.00) x 100 – (0.72 x 100)</strong></p>\n\n<h1>What if we have a NEUTRAL OUTLOOK?</h1>\n\n<p>We can still make money using a covered call, but we need a bit more capital to start.</p>\n\n<p>First, we need to buy 100 shares of AMC at 9.28, which makes our cost basis (what we paid for it) $928.</p>\n\n<p>If we think that the share price will trade mostly sideways, we can open a <strong>short, covered call</strong> position. This means we are selling the option for a buyer to purchase our 100 shares from us for a given price.</p>\n\n<p>In our example, we open a <strong>short 12C 3/26</strong> position, which means we agree to sell 100 shares of AMC on 3/26 for $12 a share. The premium for this contract is $1.00 per share, so we pocket the $100. We keep this $100 no matter what, and we can use it to offset our cost basis. So regardless of what happens, our new cost basis for 100 shares of AMC is now $828.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s see what happens on 3/26 when the contract expires:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AMC @ 10</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 12C contract expired worthless – nobody is going to exercise a 12c when the market price is only $10.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, our net gain is $<strong>172.</strong> We made 0.72 per share on each of our 100 shares as the price rose to $10, <strong>and</strong> we keep the $100 premium we were paid for selling the 12c.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AMC @ 11.99</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 12C contract still expired worthless. Our net gain is <strong>$371</strong> – we made $2.71 on the share price rising and keep the $100 premium.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AMC @ 14.50</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 12C contract ended up in the money, which means that it will be exercised. Now, we sell our shares at $12 a share, earning $1,200. We also get keep the premium, so our total proceeds are $1,300. We do lose out on the potential unrealized gains we would have had if we were free to sell the shares on the market for $14.50.</p>\n\n<p>Once the contract expires, we are free to do what we want with the shares: sell them for a profit or sell another covered call.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m590bc/alright_the_other_guy_did_an_intro_to_options/","title":"Alright - the other guy did an intro to options.
