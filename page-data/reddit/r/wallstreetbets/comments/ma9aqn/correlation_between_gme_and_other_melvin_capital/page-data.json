It&#39;s not just AMC/GME. (BBBY, IRBT, FIZZ and GSX)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Melvin Capital held put positions in these tickers but closed them during Q4 of 2020, before all of them went through a period of volatility along with GME.</strong> </li>\n<li><strong>MC hold a put position in $AG, a silver mining company that was shilled on WSB during the &#39;silver squeeze&#39; bullshit, which also followed a similiar pattern to GME in January with a rapid run-up around the 27th January.</strong> </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Link to Melvin Capital 13F filings i.e. MC&#39;s holdings, use the &#39;quarter to view&#39; drop-down to select which quarter to view. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link\">https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link</a></p>\n\n<p>From that you can view or download an excel file of MC&#39;s holdings - up to Q4 of 2020. </p>\n\n<p>Back at the end of January I was looking at the day&#39;s biggest movers on yahoo, and noticed that a few silver mining companies had gone up by around 20-25%.  This was at the time that all that bullshit about a &#39;silver squeeze&#39; was going round, so I thought it was interesting. One stood out in particular: $AG, because I had seen it mentioned in a lot of the shill posts about buying silver. Knowing that the whole &#39;silver squeeze&#39; thing was total bullshit manufactured by someone with money and a motive i.e. probably Melvin Capital, the ones who had an incentive to divert WSB attention (and money) away from GME, I started to look at the day&#39;s other biggest movers. Strap your tinfoil hats on boys and girls.</p>\n\n<p>Like I say, what I did was go through that day&#39;s (28th Jan) biggest movers, and then I looked in the 13F filing available for Melvin Capital to see if MC had positions in any of them. At the time that I was looking at this, I was using the 2020 Q3 13F holdings, but since then the Q4 13F&#39;s have been made available. I&#39;ll get on to that in a minute though. First though, I want to show you the chart for GME/SPY. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4dyzatf3bgo61.png?width=1452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27fd1c05149cb9247ee2a442114e5bdd0bc5ef2b\">https://preview.redd.it/4dyzatf3bgo61.png?width=1452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27fd1c05149cb9247ee2a442114e5bdd0bc5ef2b</a></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, during the Jan/Feb squeeze (Gamma/short, whatever your opinion is on that) GME practically inverses SPY. Correlation doesn&#39;t demonstrate causation however: the point I&#39;m making is that this is the trend that SPY was following at the time, so any correlation between GME and another stock can&#39;t really be put down to just general market trends. </p>\n\n<p>Now, these are the stocks I identified as having a significant price movement at the end of January which MC had put positions in as of the end of Q3.</p>\n\n<p><strong>$BBBY</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g11nca6cago61.png?width=1452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d23715bfefb01a62cc75f05da1ee870985b41f8b\">GME in orange, BBBY in Green. </a></p>\n\n<p>MC position as of Q3 13F:</p>\n\n<p>PUT. Market value: $48,385,000. Also their 69th biggest holding. Nice. </p>\n\n<p>Another interesting thing about $BBBY is this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1353689266660978693\"><strong>https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1353689266660978693</strong></a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1354099619408588803\">https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1354099619408588803</a> </p>\n\n<p>Cramer made a couple tweets about BBBY and linked them to WSB. Pretty sure there&#39;s one where he actually tried to driect WSB&#39;s attention to BBBY but I can&#39;t find it. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>$IRBT</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3zt6lrlwago61.png?width=1445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e5e0c62df6aefb1156dcb9f25c374542926c6c3\">$IRBT in blue GME in orange</a></p>\n\n<p>MC held a $37,950,000 market value PUT according to 13F filings for Q3. </p>\n\n<p><strong>$GSX</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t6jgqm8obgo61.png?width=1455&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=345c6d445d3dcb6f135f9b2b4345ae280bf6357c\">GSX in purple GME in orange</a></p>\n\n<p>MC held a $148,682,000 market value put position. </p>\n\n<p><strong>$FIZZ</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3usgiedqbgo61.png?width=1452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3942d0fe1c72d4e186cbf942b0a994540499f6c1\">FIZZ in yellow GME in orange</a></p>\n\n<p>MC held a  $54,408,000 put position. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally, $AG</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5jxfgox6mgo61.png?width=1462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a06d6c5dda93a145a35672dd32550a5472c8be0\">https://preview.redd.it/5jxfgox6mgo61.png?width=1462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a06d6c5dda93a145a35672dd32550a5472c8be0</a></p>\n\n<p>Now, I can&#39;t find any AG position for MC in Q3, however for Q4, they added an entirely new position. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i0hyt7fsmgo61.png?width=1766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d20308204d103dfd2c3e93cf94698d16eca5a11\">https://preview.redd.it/i0hyt7fsmgo61.png?width=1766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d20308204d103dfd2c3e93cf94698d16eca5a11</a></p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a brand new put position in the 4th quarter of 2020 worth $74m USD. If anyone has got the ticker mention data I think it would be really interesting to see the ticker mentions of things like $SLV and $AG around this period. </p>\n\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>So now to cover the Q3 vs Q4 filings, below are the Q4 statements for the previous tickers  that I stated MC held put positions in for Q3:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ye0b1yt4pgo61.png?width=1767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd8bd937433f7fb72167ee77f06ea80317e82e72\">BBBY</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bgtvsku5pgo61.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a944a913af5445e1562fa2803596a5ca636f864\">IRBT</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f7cawpk6pgo61.png?width=1771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d7cd66c5ba768d23a2d1cd1af6be5ecc328e403\">GSX</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tfix9lvcpgo61.png?width=1770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0275f1e13fc50a76970bc1e598ea1b3453562c2\">FIZZ</a></p>\n\n<p>So there was a correlation between GME and a number of other stocks that MC held short positions in as of Q3 of 2020, but they abruptly closed these positions out in Q4, before the volatility early in Q1 of 2021. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So to summarise:</strong> </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There is a correlation between GME and a number of other tickers that Melvin Capital held PUT positions in (according to their <strong>Q3</strong> 13F filings) for the period from around the 27th Jan to early Febuary 2021. </li>\n<li>According to Melvin Capital&#39;s  Q4 13F filings however, MC closed these put positions before the end of Q4. They closed their PUT positions <em>before</em> the run-up that occured in late-January 2021 across these stocks. </li>\n<li>MC opened a put position in $AG in Q4, a ticker that had a sudden, massive increase in the number of mentions on WSB around the same time GME reached it&#39;s peak. The consensus at the time was that the &#39;silver squeeze&#39; was a ploy to divert the attention of WSB onto something else away from GME. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are probably other tickers that could fit here that I&#39;ve missed too. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So what the fuck are we supposed to make of this?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Could MC have known that something was about to happen with these tickers? Why is there a correlation between a video game retailer and a soda producer? A consumer robot manufacturer (IRBT) and fucking bed-bath-and-beyond? Did MC run-up these tickers in order to reposition their short positions from new highs? </p>\n\n<p>Once the Q1 2020 13F&#39;s are released it will likely shed some light on what has gone on here but until then, unfortunately, it&#39;s up to the collective 14 brain cells of the WSB community to try and figure out if there&#39;s something going on here and whether that can give us information relating to GME (and possibly other tickers) going forward. After all, if you put enough monkeys in front of typewriters eventually they&#39;ll write some Shakespeare.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma9aqn/correlation_between_gme_and_other_melvin_capital/","title":"Correlation between GME and other Melvin Capital Holdings","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-22T18:06:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-22 18:06","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ma9aqn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma9aqn/correlation_between_gme_and_other_melvin_capital/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma9aqn/correlation_between_gme_and_other_melvin_capital/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"captin1110","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/captin1110","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"captin1110","score":1095,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME与其他Melvin Capital控股公司的相关性","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR。\n\n 1. 美尔文资本持有的其他一些股票的价格是空的\n    仓位与GME的密切相关。不仅仅是AMC/GME。(BBBY。\n    (IRBT、FIZZ和GSX)\n 2.
