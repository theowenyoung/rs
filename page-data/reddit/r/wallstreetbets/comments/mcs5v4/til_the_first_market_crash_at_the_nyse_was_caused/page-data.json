Morgan/James Hill and E. H. Harriman for control over Northern Pacific Railways. Trying to take control of the company, both parties combined bought over 94% of the float. At the same time, other investors were heavily shorting the stock (to sell to one of the parties), until at one point everyone realized that they won&#39;t be able to cover their short position because Morgan/Hill and Harriman won&#39;t sell their shares. The shorts were squeezed as they fought for the remaining 6% of the shares and drove NP from $20 to $240. To pay for the high covering share prices, the shorts liquidated their other positions, causing mass panic that rippled through the whole stock market. Overwhelming cries of &quot;sell! sell! sell!&quot; were heard at the NYSE trading floor. Temporary relief were provided when rumors of Morgan&#39;s broker&#39;s death were spread, but quickly dissipated and the panic resumed. The whole ordeal concluded only when the two parties reached a truce and the shorts were finally able to cover their position.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcs5v4/til_the_first_market_crash_at_the_nyse_was_caused/gs6jxro?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">someone corrected me and NP actually went to an intraday high of $1000/share</a>, corresponding to over $31K in today&#39;s dollars. I was only able to find some chart with longer time scale points that showed a high of $240.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcs5v4/til_the_first_market_crash_at_the_nyse_was_caused/","title":"TIL the first market crash at the NYSE was caused by an epic short squeeze","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-25T21:25:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-25 21:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mcs5v4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcs5v4/til_the_first_market_crash_at_the_nyse_was_caused/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcs5v4/til_the_first_market_crash_at_the_nyse_was_caused/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"CMScientist","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/CMScientist","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"CMScientist","score":3462,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"直到纽约证券交易所的第一次市场崩溃是由一个史诗般的空头挤压造成的。","the_new_excerpt":"1901年的恐慌[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1901]是由一个。\nJ.P.摩根/詹姆斯-希尔和E.H.哈里曼为争夺控制权而发生的对峙。\n北太平洋铁路公司。试图控制公司，双方。\n合计买入了超过94%的浮动股。同时，其他...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"直到紐約證券交易所的第一次市場崩潰是由一個史詩般的空頭擠壓造成的。","the_new_excerpt":"1901年的恐慌[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1901]是由一個。\nJ.P.摩根/詹姆斯-希爾和E.H.哈里曼爲爭奪控制權而發生的對峙。\n北太平洋鐵路公司。試圖控制公司，雙方。\n合計買入了超過94%的浮動股。同時，其他...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mux5kq","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mux5kq/see_you_on_the_moon_a_tribute_to_keith_gill/","title":"See You on the Moon - A Tribute to Keith Gill","date":"April 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"See You on the Moon - A Tribute to Keith Gill","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"月球上见--向基思-吉尔致敬","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"月球上見--向基思-吉爾致敬","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mumlqw","excerpt":"This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme\nfor today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just\nignore the theme and/or post your arguments against TA…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mumlqw/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_apr/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Apr 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 20, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Apr 20, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"ここは毎日のディスカッションの場ですから、株に関することなら何でもいいのですが、今日のテーマはテクニカル分析（TA）です。\n今日のテーマはテクニカル分析(TA)についてですが、もしTAが苦手であれば\nしかし、TAが苦手な方は、このテーマを無視するか、TAに対するあなたの主張を投稿してください。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Apr 20, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"这是每日讨论，所以任何与股票有关的都可以，但今天的主题是技术分析（TA）。\n但今天的主题是技术分析（TA），但如果TA不是你的事，那么就请\n忽略这个主题和/或发表你反对TA的论点......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Apr 20, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"這是每日討論，所以任何與股票有關的都可以，但今天的主題是技術分析（TA）。\n但今天的主題是技術分析（TA），但如果TA不是你的事，那麼就請\n忽略這個主題和/或發表你反對TA的論點......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mcs5v4","previousId":"RedditPost-mux5kq","nextId":"RedditPost-mumlqw","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcs5v4/til_the_first_market_crash_at_the_nyse_was_caused/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
