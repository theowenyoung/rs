One of the main justifications they gave for this conclusion was that “the number of recent conversations [on Reddit] including both GME and stimulus is low.”</p>\n\n<p>As some of you know, I’ve been collecting data on WSB discussion for quite a while now, and can quantitatively show that to be false.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll try to keep this brief, as I know attention spans here are short. Please don&#39;t hesitate to ask questions below.</p>\n\n<p>To start with, here is a graph of the total number of comments in my data mentioning &quot;stimulus&quot; or &quot;stimmy&quot; over time:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/68304hkrr6o61.png?width=1730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89e506d66c60fcfdb2c7f615e53cf952fa4dd522\">Stimulus Comments</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is a graph of the number of comments in my data that mention BOTH stimulus &amp; GME over time:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f5ubk3hhq6o61.png?width=1730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3b50e38cb0eafa490bcfeba1bda3b6e023409ce\">WSB comments discussing stimulus &amp; GME</a></p>\n\n<p>The drop off at the end reflects the fact that it was 3:00pm as I am writing this and the day is only partially completed. One could argue that these numbers should be normalized based on the total of number of comments per day and, while I&#39;d disagree, I&#39;ll include that graph below as well:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/003y7k0mq6o61.png?width=1730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b4b0762cf396708bdef53f795ce84ad7e0c4847\">Normalized WSB comments discussing stimulus &amp; GME</a></p>\n\n<p>From both of these graphs I see no indication of the number of recent conversations including both GME and stimulus being low, as a matter of fact it has hit all time highs over the last few days Here&#39;s a chart of the top 5 days in which stimulus was mentioned the most in my data of WSB daily discussion.</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Day</strong></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Stimulus &amp; GME mention count</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">3/15/21</td>\n<td align=\"left\">124</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">3/14/21</td>\n<td align=\"left\">103</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">3/16/21</td>\n<td align=\"left\">74</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">3/13/21</td>\n<td align=\"left\">69</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">1/14/21</td>\n<td align=\"left\">67</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>To take it a step further, we can look at what % of comments mentioning different stocks also mention stimulus, as I did recently in the graphic below. A larger proportion of comments mentioning $GME on WSB also mention stimulus than for any other major meme stocks, save for $TSLA.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/d6gj9vj7r6o61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d7f1e3d99059a70494a08da9ea571f2832a2359\">Most-discussed stocks in 2021 w/ \\&quot;stimmy ratio\\&quot;</a></p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know how the conclusion was reached that the number of recent conversations on reddit including GME and stimulus is low. Assuming that this is an honest mistake, I&#39;d encourage BofA, Market Watch, CNBC, or any of the other parties involved to get better data. There are a lot of people out there who have started collecting data on WSB, but not many who do it well and with good intentions. I&#39;ve been doing it for a while now, and I like to think I fit both those criteria which is why I feel qualified to write this post.</p>\n\n<p>Note:  I don’t have stake in $GME and don’t actively trade a portfolio, in order to avoid perceptions of bias in my analysis. This is not financial advice, or a recommendation to buy or sell any stock.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m978bh/disproving_claims_published_in_cnbc_using_data_on/","title":"Disproving claims published in CNBC using data on WSB discussion","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-20T18:55:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-20 18:55","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m978bh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m978bh/disproving_claims_published_in_cnbc_using_data_on/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m978bh/disproving_claims_published_in_cnbc_using_data_on/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/5KasH7PBX5JX96Fc4nPTnyptjadXgS1v0WBVgv2M93c.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0d86ee510ecb926041fec7e862a2d3b15f226125","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"pdwp90","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"pdwp90","score":3108,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"用WSB讨论的数据反驳CNBC发表的说法。","the_new_excerpt":"昨天，CNBC和Market Watch发表文章\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/stimulus-checks-unlikely-to-spur-another-gamestop-mania-says-bofa.html]\n研究认为，我们不应该期望人们用刺激资金来购买商品，而应该用经济刺激的方式来购买商品。\n购买GameStop的股票。他们给出的一个主要理由是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"用WSB討論的數據反駁CNBC發表的說法。","the_new_excerpt":"昨天，CNBC和Market Watch發表文章\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/stimulus-checks-unlikely-to-spur-another-gamestop-mania-says-bofa.html]\n研究認爲，我們不應該期望人們用刺激資金來購買商品，而應該用經濟刺激的方式來購買商品。\n購買GameStop的股票。他們給出的一個主要理由是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mq7fap","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mq7fap/kevin_oleary_live_now_thinks_a_second_kick_of/","title":"Kevin O'Leary Live Now thinks a second kick of life is coming to GameStop, says \"If I was short that stock right now I would be worried\"","date":"April 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ケビン・オレアリー・ライブ・ナウは、GameStopに第二の人生のキックが来ると考えており、「もし私が今その株をショートしていたら、心配していただろう」と述べています。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"Kevin O'Leary Live Now认为GameStop将迎来生命的第二脚，他说：\"如果我现在做空该股，我会很担心\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Kevin O'Leary Live Now認爲GameStop將迎來生命的第二腳，他說：\"如果我現在做空該股，我會很擔心\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mq6e0u","excerpt":"It's like a pyramid scheme where everyone is required to shill these worthless\nassets or else you won't find new people to buy in.
