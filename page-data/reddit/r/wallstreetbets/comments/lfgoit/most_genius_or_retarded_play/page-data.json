Like a sensible &quot;investor&quot; I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn&#39;t right? So fast forward 1 week and I&#39;m thinking &quot;what&#39;s the fastest way I can make my money back?&quot;. Selling puts of course. </p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn&#39;t write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren&#39;t any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can&#39;t find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn&#39;t give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it&#39;s smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it&#39;s getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I&#39;m fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can&#39;t go tits up. </p>\n\n<p>POSITIONS:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n16hgoiteag61.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74bab8d0e4a152406f91d2f50402a6d8ab94143c\">https://preview.redd.it/n16hgoiteag61.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74bab8d0e4a152406f91d2f50402a6d8ab94143c</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfgoit/most_genius_or_retarded_play/","title":"Most genius or retarded play","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T07:23:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 07:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfgoit","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfgoit/most_genius_or_retarded_play/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfgoit/most_genius_or_retarded_play/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"DoctorProfessor69","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DoctorProfessor69","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DoctorProfessor69","score":2009,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"最天才或最弱智的游戏","the_new_excerpt":"弱智，听好了。\n\n所以前段时间我在通话中YOLO了我的全部账户，4分钟就输光了。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rftx/loss_porn_for_all_the_new_people_here_yoloed_my/]。\n像一个理智的 \"投资者 \"一样，我想拿回我的钱，我的意思是谁不会吧？所以\n迅速...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"最天才或最弱智的遊戲","the_new_excerpt":"弱智，聽好了。\n\n所以前段時間我在通話中YOLO了我的全部賬戶，4分鐘就輸光了。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rftx/loss_porn_for_all_the_new_people_here_yoloed_my/]。\n像一個理智的 \"投資者 \"一樣，我想拿回我的錢，我的意思是誰不會吧？所以\n迅速...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lq3z3l","excerpt":"Well, it seems like there’s a good bit of interest in the Roblox public listing,\nso I figured we should touch on some highlights.
