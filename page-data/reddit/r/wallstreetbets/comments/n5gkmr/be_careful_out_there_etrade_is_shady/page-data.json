The type of mistakes that would likely throw the average person into a full-blown panic attack, or worse...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The first &quot;issue&quot; was during the $GME uprising. I woke up like the rest of you, except with a <strong>$234,357.55 cash call</strong> on my account. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mrndbfvwxax61.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c62fa1ae8a0f65d77c9f75e490d231fd166e4f25\">Cash Call</a></p>\n\n<p>You may be thinking, &quot;you stupid fucking idiot stop playing with margin and that wont happen&quot;, but my account was never even approved for margin lol. I owned <strong>&lt;10 shares</strong> of $GME at the time, and was selling them 1 by 1 as the price travelled through the $300&#39;s (sorry). So when I saw that I somehow had unwillingly entered a <strong>short position of 736 SHARES OF $GME AT $22.86</strong>, which my account literally did not have the ability to do, I freaked the fuck out. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vcil9kxoyax61.png?width=1091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c50088143246cfe6c270f5d6b66380aa8d837d7\">https://preview.redd.it/vcil9kxoyax61.png?width=1091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c50088143246cfe6c270f5d6b66380aa8d837d7</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m still not sure what happened that day, but E*TRADE admitted it was an &quot;error&quot; on their end. Huh, what kind of error results in a massive (and impossible) short position on the biggest stock explosion in decades? There wasn&#39;t even an order # attached to the trades...imagine being someone who checks their portfolio weekly or monthly rather than 60 times a day, and seeing this shit pop up, not knowing if you made some terrible mistake and your life was completely ruined?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/li4mkcn61bx61.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc1c9b50fcd678eb7f9a798cc2fd16bcf218966\">https://preview.redd.it/li4mkcn61bx61.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cc1c9b50fcd678eb7f9a798cc2fd16bcf218966</a></p>\n\n<p>Well a few months had passed, but last week I decided I finally wanted to upgrade my account to a margin account to allow me to sell a <em>PMCC</em> on a deep ITM $NIO call I owned. I had the cash available for the trade I wanted to make (a few thousand), so this shouldn&#39;t have been an issue. But like clockwork, the PMCC I sold for <strong>19 FUCKING DOLLARS IN PREMIUM</strong> resulted in another error. A Fed Call, for... </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nvmte0tk0bx61.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e561f141eebe3292b7a20f21baa62d7f731b76\">https://preview.redd.it/nvmte0tk0bx61.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e561f141eebe3292b7a20f21baa62d7f731b76</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>...$21,554.07!</strong> Again, after contacting E*TRADE and looking up whatever a &quot;Fed Call&quot; was, it was deemed to be yet another &quot;error&quot; on their end. The only trade I had made when margin was enabled was a profitable one, too. <strong>$8.</strong> No wonder this country has a mental health problem, thanks E*TRADE.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dkz2l0741bx61.png?width=490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b12cfa9084bd7ec6a32332284c9d25e96ce96b93\">Sure, Jan.</a></p>\n\n<p>Okay, the fed call thing was ridiculous, so the day after I was approved for the margin account, I downgraded my account (after all the trades had settled) so I wouldn&#39;t have to deal with this nonsense. I thought that would be the end of it. Until this morning, when I woke up to <em>\\</em>drumroll please*,* <strong>over $4,000 in cash missing from my account!</strong> I was the lucky winner of the E*TRADE lottery, because of all the times I&#39;ve had to contact support for their &quot;issues&quot;, I got to pay 1 months salary to a random E*TRADE employee! </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0bwntrqx2bx61.png?width=1163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63eb6e29eda6d955e9d733854cfe97a7d4157093\">Thank you, have a nice day!</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As I write this, the cash has since been deposited back into my account, but how is this acceptable? If the average person looks at their retirement account once a month and sees a hundred thousand dollar cash call, or a twenty thousand dollar &#39;Fed Call&#39;, they may not act rationally - that&#39;s a lot of fucking money. And they&#39;d have no idea if it was an error or not because you would ASSUME that a multi, multi billion dollar brokerage wouldn&#39;t make mistakes like this...or maybe not.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the point of this post is to remind people to <strong>be careful</strong>. Up until recently, this hasn&#39;t been an industry where regular people had access to these resources, and it seems like they wish it stayed that way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5gkmr/be_careful_out_there_etrade_is_shady/","title":"Be Careful Out There - E*TRADE is SHADY.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"May 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-05T21:32:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-05 21:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n5gkmr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5gkmr/be_careful_out_there_etrade_is_shady/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5gkmr/be_careful_out_there_etrade_is_shady/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"SUKnives","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SUKnives","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"SUKnives","score":1440,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Be Careful Out There - E*TRADE is SHADY.","the_new_excerpt":"E*TRADEのユーザーになって10年近くになりますが、ここ数ヶ月、私の口座でいくつかの重大な問題が発生しました。\nここ数ヶ月の間に、私の口座でいくつかの重大な問題が発生しました。\n起こってはならないことです。平均的な人ならば、きっと投げ出してしまうようなタイプのミスです。\n普通の人であれば、パニックになってしまうようなミスです。\n\n\n\n最初の問題は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在外面要小心--E*TRADE是阴暗的。","the_new_excerpt":"我是E*TRADE的用户，至今已近十年，但在过去的几个月里\n但在过去的几个月里，我的账户出现了一些重大问题，这些问题根本不应该发生。\n不应该发生的问题。这种类型的错误可能会让普通的\n陷入全面的恐慌，甚至更糟......\n\n\n\n第一个 \"问题\"...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在外面要小心--E*TRADE是陰暗的。","the_new_excerpt":"我是E*TRADE的用戶，至今已近十年，但在過去的幾個月裏\n但在過去的幾個月裏，我的賬戶出現了一些重大問題，這些問題根本不應該發生。\n不應該發生的問題。這種類型的錯誤可能會讓普通的\n陷入全面的恐慌，甚至更糟......\n\n\n\n第一個 \"問題\"...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n5lvld","excerpt":"Wow!
