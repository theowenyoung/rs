CNBC has it wrong - this didn&#39;t start with WSB. People are losing faith in the dollar and wanna hold fucking metal.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t think there&#39;s a shortage? Go try to buy a 1,000 ounce bar of silver. Google it. If you happen to find a dealer who isn&#39;t out of stock, you&#39;ll be paying an insane premium over the spot price.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not gonna get into all the silver manipulation conspiracies. Let&#39;s stick to Retard Economics 101: if there&#39;s a shortage of the good it means the price is too damn low.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the differential between the physical spot price of silver, and the futures price in the COMEX there&#39;s an arbitrage: Anybody with any serious cash today could take silver delivery from the COMEX at $27, and quickly flip it for well over $30. Futures deliveries last year were already at a record:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/djlle4wb8hh61.png?width=1466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd198b6fa8db58121a9654f2e46fe668ec342268\">https://preview.redd.it/djlle4wb8hh61.png?width=1466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd198b6fa8db58121a9654f2e46fe668ec342268</a></p>\n\n<p>But the amount of folks standing for March delivery might just break the bank... because there&#39;s just not enough Silver to deliver to everyone who wants it. That&#39;s why (as another WSB post already detailed) The SLV ETF amended their prospectus to basically say <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BullionStar/status/1360703958029905921\">we can&#39;t actually get the silver that we need.</a></p>\n\n<p>If silver futures start creeping up, this thing could completely snowball. Because those industrial consumers of silver - Tesla, Apple, Medical stuff - absolutely cannot afford to have their production lines shut down for a month because of one input, and will pay anything to make sure they get those 1k bars in hand.</p>\n\n<p>How to make tendies? Look what happened to AG and SILJ a few weeks ago when Silver went up 9%. Those two tickers FLEW. Buy calls on them for July if you&#39;re responsible, April if you&#39;re a degenerate gambler.</p>\n\n<p>How to do your part and make sure the squeeze happens? Buy PSLV. That fund is going to actually take delivery of 1,000 ounce bars on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: $PSLV shares, $AG July calls, strike 20,  $SILJ August calls strike 25.</p>\n\n<p>DON&#39;T BUY $SLV</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljsu1c/there_is_officially_a_silver_shortage_and_silver/","title":"There is officially a silver shortage, and silver miners ($AG and $SILJ) are going to triple by May.
