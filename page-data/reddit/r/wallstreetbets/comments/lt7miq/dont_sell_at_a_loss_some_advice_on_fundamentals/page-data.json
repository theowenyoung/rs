I wrote some basic advice I&#39;ll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action, or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper-handing. Paper-handing is fundamentally bad investment practice, especially if you&#39;re a new investor. I&#39;ll explain why.</p>\n\n<p><em>DISLAIMER: I&#39;ve only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff, and he hasn’t steered me wrong yet. So take it for what it’s worth... But based on all the fact that paper-handing is even an issue here, you apes clearly need this advice.</em> <strong><em>EDIT: Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing, which doesn&#39;t encourage YOLO-ing. There are other approaches (which often require more experience) but I feel this is most accessible to new investors. GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything. Well, everything that you don’t think will go bankrupt or get delisted.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>New traders, or people who are thinking of becoming new traders, should read this.</strong> Especially if you&#39;re new, I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market. This applies to all stock, not just GME. If you&#39;re experienced, it might just sound like I&#39;m explaining at length why 2 + 2 = 4, but since a friend of a friend told me he paper-handed on GME (sold the dip), I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I would encourage people to buy GME, but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while.</strong> By this I mean <strong>NEVER SELL AT A LOSS</strong>. Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down. All newbie investors should adhere to this rule just in general. Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground, or don’t buy it at all.</p>\n\n<p>Many investors, myself included, follow this rule religiously, not just with GME but with all stocks. I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss, I just held or bought more. COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out? I just held and was fine... should have bought more. If everyone bought into GME with this mindset, I bet it would go to Pluto easily.</p>\n\n<p>If you sell at a loss, you are donating to the &quot;save the short sellers&quot; fund out of your own wallet, fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes, and you’re not even following sound investment practice. Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy. If you’re thinking of investing so much that you’ll wuss out, poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red... just don’t. Emotion and the stock market do not mix well.</p>\n\n<p>Stop losses (below purchase price) are also for pansies and genuine idiots. “I’ll sell you some stock... but only if you give me a bad enough price on it.” Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down... if you feel like you need a stop loss, you&#39;re investing more than you should. Instead of being stupid, maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: personally, in the case of GME, I don’t have any limit sells either. From what I can tell on past short squeezes, the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down. So as long as you keep an eye on GME when it actually does skyrocket, you should have plenty of time. Set price alerts and relax. No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid-launch.</p>\n\n<p>Although, if you want you can try to profit off GME volatility. Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I&#39;m not sure they deserve it. As far as I know, buying low and selling high doesn’t really help HFs, it drives the price up (just not as much as buying and holding). But personally, my philosophy is, I can take baby profits anytime... who knows when something like this GME rise will happen again. So I’m holding (101 shares at cost average $106/share).</p>\n\n<p>Want to get into the game now? You could always just buy a few shares, and keep the rest of what you’re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip. And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more, bringing your cost average down. Ideally, you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero. Always try to keep cash in reserve.</p>\n\n<p>Locked yourself in at a high price? That&#39;s why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down. Didn&#39;t keep any cash in reserve? Guess you&#39;re stuck waiting for one of three things: 1) the short squeeze which will likely (though not certainly) happen, 2) for the price of GME to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases, or 3) you get your hands on some more cash you&#39;re willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down. <strong>DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS</strong> and you will never lose (edit: well, seldom, if ever. Unless the company goes bankrupt, a rare occurrence. This is why you don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket, and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero, it won&#39;t swallow your portfolio). Hedge funds and billionaires know this, that&#39;s why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic. They bought the dip while regular folks paper-handed and got even poorer.</p>\n\n<p>One more little trick. If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares, then even if your position goes “underwater,” you can always sell calls at above your average cost, bring DOWN your cost basis, and make money off your stock “risk free” while still following the rule of never sell at a loss. Although if you did it right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze. Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen, and you&#39;ll need to be patient and, like I said before, say goodbye to your money for a while.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Just to reiterate, there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies. Trade however you want, just don’t paper hand GME. I would also note that you <em>can</em> sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule, if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price. It still follows the rule of &quot;don&#39;t sell at a loss.&quot; Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100, doesn&#39;t matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Yes I know about opportunity cost. It does apply if you know something the general public doesn’t (rare if you’re just a low IQ ape but GME was/is an exception). Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn&#39;t, it could be a coin flip whether you&#39;ll hit rock bottom. In an ideal world, you can keep some money in reserve so you don’t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities. Yes I know about (and agree with) the sunk cost fallacy. My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal, lowering the cost basis, not “doubling down” on sunk cost.</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr 🦍buy 🍌, don’t give 🐍 🍌 unless 🐍 give more than 🦍pay for 🍌</p>\n\n<p>Not financial advice.
