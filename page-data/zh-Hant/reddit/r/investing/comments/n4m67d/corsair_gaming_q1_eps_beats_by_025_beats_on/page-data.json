Supplies of key components remain tight but we have been able to support our plans and will continue to work on this issue for the rest of the year. As a result of our stronger-than-expected first quarter performance and our current views for the rest of the year, we raised our 2021 annual guidance,” stated Andy Paul, Chief Executive Officer of Corsair.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/n4m67d/corsair_gaming_q1_eps_beats_by_025_beats_on/","title":"Corsair Gaming Q1: EPS beats by $0.25, beats on revenue; raises full-year outlook","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"May 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-04T13:06:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-04 13:06","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n4m67d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n4m67d/corsair_gaming_q1_eps_beats_by_025_beats_on/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n4m67d/corsair_gaming_q1_eps_beats_by_025_beats_on/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Chippye","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chippye","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Chippye","score":757,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Corsair Gaming第1四半期：EPSは0.25ドル、収益は上回る、通期見通しを上方修正","the_new_excerpt":"コルセアゲーミング（NASDAQ:CRSR）。\n\n- 第1四半期の非GAAPベースのEPSは0.58ドルで0.25ドルの差、GAAPベースのEPSは0.47ドルで0.18ドルの差。\n\n- 売上高529.4百万ドル（前年同期比72％増）は76.13百万ドルの増収。\n\n- ゲームおよびクリエイター向け周辺機器の売上高は、前年同期比132％増の1億7,590万ドル。ゲーム\nコンポーネントおよびシステムの売上高は、52％増の3億5,350万ドル。\n\n- グロス...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Corsair Gaming第一季度：EPS增长0.25美元，收入增长；提高全年展望","the_new_excerpt":"Corsair Gaming (NASDAQ:CRSR):\n\n- 第一季度非美国通用会计准则EPS为0.58美元，超出0.25美元；美国通用会计准则EPS为0.47美元，超出0.18美元。\n\n- 收入为5.294亿美元（同比增长72%），比上年同期增长7613万美元。\n\n- 游戏和创造者周边设备的销售额增长了132%，达到1.759亿美元。游戏\n组件和系统的收入增长了52%，达到3.535亿美元。\n\n- 毛利...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Corsair Gaming第一季度：EPS增長0.25美元，收入增長；提高全年展望","the_new_excerpt":"Corsair Gaming (NASDAQ:CRSR):\n\n- 第一季度非美國通用會計準則EPS爲0.58美元，超出0.25美元；美國通用會計準則EPS爲0.47美元，超出0.18美元。\n\n- 收入爲5.294億美元（同比增長72%），比上年同期增長7613萬美元。\n\n- 遊戲和創造者周邊設備的銷售額增長了132%，達到1.759億美元。遊戲\n組件和系統的收入增長了52%，達到3.535億美元。\n\n- 毛利...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n4l1ye","excerpt":"If you ever met CANCER you must know how tough it is, tough to fight with it,\ntough to watch how your beloved struggle and sometimes the only thing that can\nhelp is chemo!\n\nBut chemo also not easy to go through, thats why you need to know about G1\nTherapeutics and Cosela!\n$GTHX - G1 Therapeutics\n\n *…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/n4l1ye/g1_therapeutics_as_a_future_of_oncology/","title":"G1 Therapeutics as a future of oncology!","date":"May 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"オンコロジーの未来を担うG1セラピューティクス!","the_new_excerpt":"もしあなたが癌に出会ったことがあれば、それがどれほど過酷なものか知っているはずです。\n最愛の人が苦しんでいるのを見るのも辛く、時には助けになるのが化学療法だけということもあります。\n化学療法です。\n\nしかし、化学療法も簡単ではありません。だからこそ、G1セラピューティクスとCoselaを知る必要があるのです。\nセラピューティクスとコセラを知ってください\nGTHX - G1セラピューティクス\n\n *...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"G1治疗法是肿瘤学的未来!","the_new_excerpt":"如果你遇到过癌症，你一定知道它是多么艰难，与它斗争的艰难。\n艰难地看着你所爱的人如何挣扎，有时唯一能帮助的就是\n是化疗!\n\n但化疗也不是那么容易经历的，这就是为什么你需要了解G1\nTherapeutics和Cosela!\n$GTHX - G1 Therapeutics\n\n *...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"G1治療法是腫瘤學的未來!","the_new_excerpt":"如果你遇到過癌症，你一定知道它是多麼艱難，與它鬥爭的艱難。\n艱難地看着你所愛的人如何掙扎，有時唯一能幫助的就是\n是化療!\n\n但化療也不是那麼容易經歷的，這就是爲什麼你需要了解G1\nTherapeutics和Cosela!\n$GTHX - G1 Therapeutics\n\n *...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-n4oegm","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4oegm/may_the_fourth_be_with_you/","title":"May the Fourth Be With You","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"May 04, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"メイ・ザ・フォー・ビー・ウィズ・ユー","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"愿第四届会议与你同在","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"願第四屆會議與你同在","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-n4m67d","previousId":"RedditPost-n4l1ye","nextId":"RedditPost-n4oegm","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/n4m67d/corsair_gaming_q1_eps_beats_by_025_beats_on/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
