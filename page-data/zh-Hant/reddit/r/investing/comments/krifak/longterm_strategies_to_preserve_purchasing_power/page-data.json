I’m not some rich kid, this money is the result of 10 years of grueling work. Long story short, I want to get out. Actually, I’m already out (85% cash), but I realized that even cash is an explicit decision. Not only cash is a decision, even the currency is a decision. I’m originally from Europe and it’s likely that I’ll go back at some point. At the moment I sit on USD 425k, but I can imagine a number of reasons why cash might be a bad idea. With a timeframe of 20 years:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>USD might depreciate substantially w.r.t. to EUR, so my hard-earned money might be worth substantially less in my home country.</p></li>\n<li><p>Inflation is inevitably going to decrease the value of cash over time.</p></li>\n<li><p>New currencies like Bitcoin might devalue traditional fiat currencies. I’m not a fan of crypto-currencies, but the truth is no one knows what the financial landscape is going to look like in a few decades.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My question is: how do I preserve the purchasing power of my savings in a safe and currency-agnostic way? I’m not after crazy returns, I just want to make sure that my current purchasing power is preserved.</p>\n\n<p>The same arguments that apply to cash also seem to apply to other investment classes: you can buy real estate, but there may be a housing bubble, you can buy gold, but people may lose interest in it as a hedge. There doesn’t seem to be a truly neutral long-term investment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/krifak/longterm_strategies_to_preserve_purchasing_power/","title":"Long-term strategies to preserve purchasing power","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-06T13:52:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-06 13:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"krifak","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/krifak/longterm_strategies_to_preserve_purchasing_power/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/krifak/longterm_strategies_to_preserve_purchasing_power/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"asml84","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/asml84","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"asml84","score":105,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"维持购买力的长期策略","the_new_excerpt":"让我从提供一些背景开始：我的投资组合坐拥500K，但\n当前股市的气候让我很害怕。我不是什么富家子弟，这\n钱是10年辛勤工作的结果。长话短说，我想\n滚出去。实际上，我已经没钱了(85%现金)，但是我意识到…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"維持購買力的長期策略","the_new_excerpt":"讓我從提供一些背景開始：我的投資組合坐擁500K，但\n當前股市的氣候讓我很害怕。我不是什麼富家子弟，這\n錢是10年辛勤工作的結果。長話短說，我想\n滾出去。實際上，我已經沒錢了(85%現金)，但是我意識到…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l4e49x","excerpt":"Not to be the party-pooper but this shit will end up for a few of you people\nvery bad.
