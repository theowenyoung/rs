It’s down 12% from late November highs.</p>\n\n<p>But for a name like Costco, a 12% move is rather significant. It’s not just significant – it’s a buying opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Costco did take a modest hit during the pandemic, in part due to store closures. For instance, in April same-store sales excluding gasoline and foreign currency effects were flat. That’s a huge disappointment by Costco’s high standards.</p>\n\n<p>But as stores reopened, Costco immediately got back on track. In June, for instance, same-store sales rose 14% on the same basis. For the third quarter (ending May 10), Costco drove 4.8% same-store growth. In Q4, the figure accelerated to better than 11%. Growth in December and January averaged better than 8%.</p>\n\n<p>There’s not much in the numbers to suggest anything has changed. The pandemic caused a bit of volatility, yes, but Costco still grew adjusted same-store sales 9% in FY2020 and 6% the year before.\nAs far as e-commerce goes, the pandemic has given Costco a chance to build out its own business. E-commerce revenue grew 50% in FY2020 and climbed another 18% through the first 22 weeks of FY2021.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that Costco’s profit comes largely from membership fees. In FY2020, for instance, membership fees were about 65% of operating profit. which was actually down from 71% the year before. Essentially, Costco turns about 1% of its sales into operating profit, then tacks on membership revenue.</p>\n\n<p>That membership revenue is benefiting from customers acquired last year. Most are going to stick around for the long haul. The boost here isn’t like that of, say, a grocery store, whose sales will return to pre-pandemic levels as normalcy returns.</p>\n\n<p>Remember also that membership revenue is part of why COST stock is expensive – and has been for years. Yes, this is a fantastically well-run company. But the model’s reliance on membership fees creates faster growth as well.</p>\n\n<p>An extra dollar in membership fees drops to the operating profit line at huge margins. And so Costco can grow earnings faster than most any other brick-and-mortar retailer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lvv33p/costco_stock_is_an_easy_buy_on_the_dip_cost_stock/","title":"Costco Stock Is an Easy Buy on the Dip COST stock is one of the best in the market for investing in future dividends– and it's now on sale","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T07:44:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 07:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvv33p","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvv33p/costco_stock_is_an_easy_buy_on_the_dip_cost_stock/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvv33p/costco_stock_is_an_easy_buy_on_the_dip_cost_stock/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"DangerStranger138","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DangerStranger138","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DangerStranger138","score":128,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"好市多股票是一个简单的购买在Dip COST股票是最好的投资在未来的股息市场之一，现在它的销售。","the_new_excerpt":"Costco股票是一个轻松的买入在Dip COST股票是一个最好的在\n市场--现在正在销售\n[https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2021/03/cost-stock-costco-easy-buy-on-the-dip/]\n\n2021年至今，科创板股价下跌超过9%。从11月底开始下跌了12%。\n高。\n\n但是，对于一个名字像...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"好市多股票是一個簡單的購買在Dip COST股票是最好的投資在未來的股息市場之一，現在它的銷售。","the_new_excerpt":"Costco股票是一個輕鬆的買入在Dip COST股票是一個最好的在\n市場--現在正在銷售\n[https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2021/03/cost-stock-costco-easy-buy-on-the-dip/]\n\n2021年至今，科創板股價下跌超過9%。從11月底開始下跌了12%。\n高。\n\n但是，對於一個名字像...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m6k3fb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6k3fb/338k_raised_alreadymonke_strong_together/","title":"$338k raised already...monke strong together 🚀🚀","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"已经筹集了33.8万美金......和尚强强联手 Ὠ🚀Ὠ。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"已經籌集了33.8萬美金......和尚強強聯手 Ὠ🚀Ὠ。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m6mcro","excerpt":"So, I've very recently started investing (been actively following the market\nsince about august and after in hindsight sitting at the sidelines way too long\nstarted in late december).
