The discussions were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p>\n\n<p>Shares in Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce firm, finished down 3.9% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange while Tencent, a gaming and social media behemoth, lost 4.7%. Alibaba’s U.S.-listed shares closed down just over 5% on the news on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>Some investors expressed skepticism, however, that Alibaba and Tencent would face long-term restrictions - given that they are worth a combined $1.3 trillion, widely held by U.S. investors and the likely reputational and financial hit to U.S. stock markets.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s a very bad policy and there’s enough money in Asia, lots and getting bigger, that one shouldn’t force these companies out of America,” said Thomas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Investment Management in Toronto and an investor in the New York Stock Exchange. “Money and markets should be neutral.”</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-alibaba-tencent-idUSKBN29C04Y\">Reuters</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kscznp/us_considering_adding_alibaba_tencent_to_china/","title":"U.S. considering adding Alibaba, Tencent to China investment ban","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-07T17:07:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-07 17:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kscznp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kscznp/us_considering_adding_alibaba_tencent_to_china/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kscznp/us_considering_adding_alibaba_tencent_to_china/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Dagoru95","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dagoru95","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Dagoru95","score":386,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"美国考虑将阿里巴巴、腾讯纳入中国投资禁令","the_new_excerpt":"特朗普政府正在考虑增加科技巨头阿里巴巴和腾讯\n被列入据称由中国军方拥有或控制的公司黑名单，\n两名知情人士周三称。\n\n瞄准亚洲最有价值的两家公司将是美国总统唐纳德\n特朗普的…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國考慮將阿里巴巴、騰訊納入中國投資禁令","the_new_excerpt":"特朗普政府正在考慮增加科技巨頭阿里巴巴和騰訊\n被列入據稱由中國軍方擁有或控制的公司黑名單，\n兩名知情人士週三稱。\n\n瞄準亞洲最有價值的兩家公司將是美國總統唐納德\n特朗普的…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l4w1xq","excerpt":"NOKIA - Why I think their price will rise\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am simply stating what I have found and what I think\n\nRemember that phone company that everyone used?\n\nNOKIA ($NOK) - Is currently priced at $4.22 - UNDERVALUED.\n\nConsensus price estimates are at $4.98 and that's solely based on its assets…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l4w1xq/why_nokia_is_a_buy_and_the_return_of_the_90s/","title":"Why Nokia is a buy and the return of the 90s companies","date":"January 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么要买诺基亚，为什么要买90年代公司的回归？","the_new_excerpt":"NOKIA - 为什么他们他们的价格会上升？\n\n还记得那个大家都在用的电话公司吗？\n\nNOKIA($NOK)--目前价格为4.22美元--未被看好。\n\n共识价格估计在4.98美元，这完全是基于其资产和。\n市值。如果考虑到他们最近的成功后...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼要買諾基亞，爲什麼要買90年代公司的迴歸？","the_new_excerpt":"NOKIA - 爲什麼他們他們的價格會上升？\n\n還記得那個大家都在用的電話公司嗎？\n\nNOKIA($NOK)--目前價格爲4.22美元--未被看好。\n\n共識價格估計在4.98美元，這完全是基於其資產和。\n市值。如果考慮到他們最近的成功後...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l4tfjl","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4tfjl/cramer_goes_off_on_analyst_and_sides_with_us_on/","title":"Cramer goes off on Analyst and sides with us on GME :)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 25, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Cramer在Analyst上发飙，在GME上站在我们这边：)","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Cramer在Analyst上發飆，在GME上站在我們這邊：)","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kscznp","previousId":"RedditPost-l4w1xq","nextId":"RedditPost-l4tfjl","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kscznp/us_considering_adding_alibaba_tencent_to_china/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
