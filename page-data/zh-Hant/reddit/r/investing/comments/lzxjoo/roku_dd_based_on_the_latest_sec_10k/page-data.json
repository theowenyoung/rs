So, at the current quote of slightly above $350, their market cap is $44 Billion</li>\n<li><p>2020 revenue was $1.778 Billion, up 57.5 % over 2019  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Player (hardware) revenue was $510 M, up 31.6 % YoY (good number)</li>\n<li>Platform revenue was $1.27 B, up 71.1 % YoY (excellent number)</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>Gross margins were 45.45% up 158 basis points YoY  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Player (HW) margins were 8.55% up 414 bps YoY</li>\n<li>Platform (SW) margins were 60.3% down 413 bps YoY</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>Number of shares were up 7.6 % YoY</p></li>\n<li><p>Op-ex was up 47.9 % (S&amp;M 67 %, G&amp;A 48.8 %, R&amp;D 34.25 %), all YoY</p></li>\n<li><p>They do not use much leverage, current portion of LTD is below $100M</p></li>\n<li><p>Cash position of a little over a billion dollars</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So,  &quot;player&quot; is their foot in the door, but &quot;platform&quot; is where they make  money. Most of ROKU&#39;s platforms are not in the premium segment, but  found in the value Smart TV segment</p>\n\n<p>ROKU&#39;s  current market share is a tad shy of 10% of the ~300M Smart TVs sold in  2020, and ROKU claims a 33% market share in the USA</p>\n\n<p><em>I got into this wanting to trash ROKU. Instead, I &quot;see&quot; what they are accomplishing,</em> <strong><em>with the exception of earning money (net income)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Valuation Method: Look at HW and SW separately</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A $510M HW company with a 32 % growth rate, and 8.5% gross margins. Hard to value at over 2x sales. So, let&#39;s call it $1 Billion</li>\n<li>A  $1.27 Billion SW company with 60% gross margins, and a 71% growth rate.  This is harder to put a firm number on, but anywhere from 10x to 20x  sales. So, $12.7 B to $25 B</li>\n<li>Add them up, and I get a range of $14 B to $26 B, or a stock price between $113 to $209</li>\n<li>For reference, Morningstar&#39;s FVE estimate is $150 with a high degree of uncertainty</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion: ROKU is seriously overvalued at the current &quot;depressed&quot; quote of $350+/share.</strong> <em>My valuation metrics are &quot;more than generous&quot;.</em> <strong><em>This is not financial advice</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000156459021009021/roku-10k_20201231.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000156459021009021/roku-10k_20201231.htm</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lzxjoo/roku_dd_based_on_the_latest_sec_10k/","title":"ROKU DD based on the latest SEC 10K","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-07T22:08:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-07 22:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lzxjoo","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lzxjoo/roku_dd_based_on_the_latest_sec_10k/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lzxjoo/roku_dd_based_on_the_latest_sec_10k/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"bapcha","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bapcha","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bapcha","score":141,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"根据证监会最新的10K，ROKU DD。","the_new_excerpt":"由于有一些关于ARKK的讨论，以及事实上，我不希望\n碰了TSLA，我想，为什么不试试ROKU呢？\n\n我很喜欢Roku的产品--我家里有一台流媒体播放器，公司经营得很好。\n大多时候（我的BIL在那里工作过一段时间)\n\n 1. 他们有1.24亿股出....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"根據證監會最新的10K，ROKU DD。","the_new_excerpt":"由於有一些關於ARKK的討論，以及事實上，我不希望\n碰了TSLA，我想，爲什麼不試試ROKU呢？\n\n我很喜歡Roku的產品--我家裏有一臺流媒體播放器，公司經營得很好。\n大多時候（我的BIL在那裏工作過一段時間)\n\n 1. 他們有1.24億股出....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mc6hym","excerpt":"its amusing,and maddening too how all the news outlets,business\nchannels,pundits,economists always try every day to say why the market moved\nlike it did on any given day.instead of just saying the truth......we havent got\na clue......they are paid to make up some reason.its like why the gas price…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mc6hym/what_i_noticed_in_the_market/","title":"what I noticed in the market","date":"March 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我在市场上注意到的","the_new_excerpt":"这很有趣，也很疯狂，所有的新闻机构，商业机构，都是如此。\n渠道，专家，经济学家总是试图每天说为什么市场的移动\n而不是只说实话......，我们没有得到。\na clue......they are paid to make up some reason.its like why the gas price...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我在市場上注意到的","the_new_excerpt":"這很有趣，也很瘋狂，所有的新聞機構，商業機構，都是如此。\n渠道，專家，經濟學家總是試圖每天說爲什麼市場的移動\n而不是隻說實話......，我們沒有得到。\na clue......they are paid to make up some reason.its like why the gas price...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mc5ecl","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc5ecl/wifes_bf_car/","title":"Wife’s BF car","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 24, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"妻子的BF车","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"妻子的BF車","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lzxjoo","previousId":"RedditPost-mc6hym","nextId":"RedditPost-mc5ecl","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lzxjoo/roku_dd_based_on_the_latest_sec_10k/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
