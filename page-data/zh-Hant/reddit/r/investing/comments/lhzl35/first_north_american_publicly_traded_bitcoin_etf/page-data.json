Gemini Trust Company LLC will be sub-custodian for the fund, and CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services Co. will act as fund administrator.</p>\n\n<p>BTCC has a 1 per cent management fee, and will invest in the physical form of bitcoin rather than futures that would allow investors to speculate on the price at a later date. The fund will track the TradeBlock XBX Index, which uses an algorithm to calculate the consolidated price of bitcoin every second.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhzl35/first_north_american_publicly_traded_bitcoin_etf/","title":"First North American Publicly traded Bitcoin ETF Approved by Canadian Securities Regulator","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T14:07:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 14:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lhzl35","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhzl35/first_north_american_publicly_traded_bitcoin_etf/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhzl35/first_north_american_publicly_traded_bitcoin_etf/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"buddhist-truth","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/buddhist-truth","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"buddhist-truth","score":75,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"首只北美公开交易的比特币ETF获加拿大证券监管机构批准。","the_new_excerpt":"北美首只比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）已获。\n获得加拿大金融监管机构的批准。\n\n据周四的一份决定文件显示，收到加拿大金融监管机构的批准后，加拿大金融监管机构将对该\n安大略省证券委员会是根据多边文书护照提交的。\n系统在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"首隻北美公開交易的比特幣ETF獲加拿大證券監管機構批准。","the_new_excerpt":"北美首隻比特幣交易所交易基金（ETF）已獲。\n獲得加拿大金融監管機構的批准。\n\n據週四的一份決定文件顯示，收到加拿大金融監管機構的批准後，加拿大金融監管機構將對該\n安大略省證券委員會是根據多邊文書護照提交的。\n系統在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lt3fuw","excerpt":"There's already enough said about this stock if you've been paying attention.\nThe price isn't at fair value yet.
