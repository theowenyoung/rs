Earnings are also expected to be released this year before the merger vote on the 20th, and are expected to show good growth from the company.</p></li>\n<li><p>Speaking of the merger, GHIV is disgustingly low for a SPAC so close to merging at only ~35% from NAV. It jumped up last month but was brought down last week. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am aware that this sub does not like riskier plays like SPACs, but I really do think that UWM is a solid company with established revenue that could be a long term hold.
