Put simply, this company makes BANK.</p>\n\n<p>Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing&#39;s rise, and we can&#39;t extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.</p>\n\n<p>But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN&#39;s annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. (I&#39;ve calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)</p>\n\n<p>I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won&#39;t be participating in it. It&#39;s pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days</p>\n\n<p>But let&#39;s say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income.)</p>\n\n<p>The combined market caps of ICE and the nasdaq (operating the NYSE and nasdaq exchanges) &lt; $100 Billion.</p>\n\n<p>Crazy.</p>\n\n<p>(I hope you all know what &quot;the thing&quot; is)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mlltn1/coinbase_announces_first_quarter_2021_estimated/","title":"Coinbase Announces First Quarter 2021 Estimated Results","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"April 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-07T01:17:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-07 01:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mlltn1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mlltn1/coinbase_announces_first_quarter_2021_estimated/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mlltn1/coinbase_announces_first_quarter_2021_estimated/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"fg123____","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/fg123____","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"fg123____","score":289,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"コインベース、2021年第1四半期の推定業績を発表","the_new_excerpt":"https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2021/Coinbase-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Estimated-Results-and-Full-Year-2021-Outlook/default.aspx\n\n\n\n> 2021年第1四半期について、当社は現時点で以下のように見込んでいます。\n> 2021年3月31日に終了した3ヵ月間のうちに、または3ヵ月間のうちに。\n> \n> 検証された...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Coinbase公布2021年第一季度预估财报","the_new_excerpt":"https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2021/Coinbase-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Estimated-Results-and-Full-Year-2021-Outlook/default.aspx\n\n\n\n>对于2021年一季度，公司目前预计如下： 1．\n> 截至2021年3月31日止的三个月，或在这三个月内。\n> \n> 已验证...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Coinbase公佈2021年第一季度預估財報","the_new_excerpt":"https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2021/Coinbase-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Estimated-Results-and-Full-Year-2021-Outlook/default.aspx\n\n\n\n>對於2021年一季度，公司目前預計如下： 1．\n> 截至2021年3月31日止的三個月，或在這三個月內。\n> \n> 已驗證...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1389918721129553925","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1389918721129553925","title":"New covid-19 cases in the US are now down 81% from their peak in January, lowest levels since last October. https://t.co/DxeZzLA7PC","date":"May 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"米国におけるコビド19の新規感染者数は、1月のピーク時から81％減少し、昨年10月以来の低水準となった。https://t.co/DxeZzLA7PC","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国新的covid-19病例现在比1月份的峰值下降了81%，是去年10月以来的最低水平。https://t.co/DxeZzLA7PC","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國新的covid-19病例現在比1月份的峯值下降了81%，是去年10月以來的最低水平。https://t.co/DxeZzLA7PC","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1390141423933181954","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1390141423933181954","title":"The surge in US inflation expectations continues unabated, highest since July 2008... https://t.co/VW1Sqaoz1s","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"May 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"米国のインフレ期待の高まりは衰えず、2008年7月以来の高水準に... https://t.co/VW1Sqaoz1s","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国通胀预期的激增有增无减，为2008年7月以来最高... https://t.co/VW1Sqaoz1s","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國通脹預期的激增有增無減，爲2008年7月以來最高... https://t.co/VW1Sqaoz1s","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mlltn1","previousId":"TweetPost-1389918721129553925","nextId":"TweetPost-1390141423933181954","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mlltn1/coinbase_announces_first_quarter_2021_estimated/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
