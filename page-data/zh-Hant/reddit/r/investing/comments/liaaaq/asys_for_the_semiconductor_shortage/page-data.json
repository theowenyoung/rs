This hurt ASYS and took what started as a good year and made it OK.  For a small company they have little debt and 45 million in cash.  </p>\n\n<p>This year is still Covid effected as many orders are in the urgent discussion phase.  So revenues this quarter came in at 18 million at the high end of guidance but lower that a pre Covid first quarter last year.</p>\n\n<p>Going forward ASYS projects Q2 2021 to be at 18-20 million vs 14.5 million last year.  The discussions with big names since they provide equipment to 3 out of the top 5 power semiconductors is getting urgent.  You should listen to their conference call to hear more.  </p>\n\n<p>A larger alternative to smaller ASYS would be Applied Materials AMAT which will see huge growth due to all the capital expansion.  This is pretty heavy with the supply shortage being such big news.  Everything is getting smarter and needing semiconductors now a days.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/liaaaq/asys_for_the_semiconductor_shortage/","title":"ASYS for the semiconductor shortage.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T22:54:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 22:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"liaaaq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/liaaaq/asys_for_the_semiconductor_shortage/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/liaaaq/asys_for_the_semiconductor_shortage/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"JamesHolden1975","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesHolden1975","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"JamesHolden1975","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"半导体短缺的ASYS。","the_new_excerpt":"Amtech Systems ASYS为半导体行业提供资本设备。\n尤其是那些为汽车提供芯片的企业。\n\n昨天，一些头条新闻全球半导体短缺\n[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"半導體短缺的ASYS。","the_new_excerpt":"Amtech Systems ASYS爲半導體行業提供資本設備。\n尤其是那些爲汽車提供芯片的企業。\n\n昨天，一些頭條新聞全球半導體短缺\n[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ltep3k","excerpt":"I went into a GameStop with my girlfriend so she could buy her normal little\nPokemon knick knacks and t-shirts....
