It&#39;s becoming unhealthy. Surely the old folks here that have seen some other types of markets can actually share some thoughs and experiences on this, because you can&#39;t deny that the last months have been CRAZY: everyone and their mom seems to be into stocks.</p>\n\n<p>You can try to justify this rally al you want with the M2 money supply charts, the hype around tech and the american patriotism, the &quot;new world order&quot; etc., but valuations just don&#39;t lie and THEY MATTER. Right? Do valuations matter? Because that is what I was taught, but everybody seems to have forgotten this. Everybody overlooks the fact that, during the last 150 years, stocks were more expensive than this only during the dot-com bubble.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, will things ever get back to normal? <strong>And don&#39;t misunderstand me</strong>: I don&#39;t mean that stocks prices need to plunge, I just mean that valuations need to, which is not necessarily the same. And if they do, and all of this goes bust, is this crazy new interest around stocks here to stay for good or will the majority of people move on once the dust has settled? Was the dot-com like this on a retail level?</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m not talking about GME, that is clearly a once in a decade squeeze event ... I&#39;m talking about everything else</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l48ymg/question_for_the_seasoned_investors_here_this/","title":"Question for the seasoned investors here: this WILL go bust at some point, right?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-25T16:09:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-25 16:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l48ymg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l48ymg/question_for_the_seasoned_investors_here_this/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l48ymg/question_for_the_seasoned_investors_here_this/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"xmrptbx","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/xmrptbx","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"xmrptbx","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"在这里问一下经验丰富的投资者：这个会在某个时间点破产吧？","the_new_excerpt":"我进入这个游戏只有2-3年的时间，因为我很年轻，我变得\n越来越多的担心，因为每一个备忘录的股票是在这个竞价到平流层。\n疯牛的狂热。越来越不健康了。当然，这里的老人们有\n看到一些其他类型的市场其实可以分享一些...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在這裏問一下經驗豐富的投資者：這個會在某個時間點破產吧？","the_new_excerpt":"我進入這個遊戲只有2-3年的時間，因爲我很年輕，我變得\n越來越多的擔心，因爲每一個備忘錄的股票是在這個競價到平流層。\n瘋牛的狂熱。越來越不健康了。當然，這裏的老人們有\n看到一些其他類型的市場其實可以分享一些...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lc7lmb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc7lmb/whatever_happens_fucking_hold/","title":"WHATEVER HAPPENS - FUCKING HOLD","date":"February 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"无论发生什么事 - 他妈的举行","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"無論發生什麼事 - 他媽的舉行","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lcuiaj","excerpt":"I just want to get this message to all sufferers and take a moment to talk about\nthe negativity being thrown around and the potential mental health crisis that\ncould unfold for many people here.\n\nI know the general sentiment is to shit on all the people with negativity about\n\"you should've sold when…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcuiaj/to_all_sufferers_of_the_whole_fiasco_mental/","title":"To All Sufferers of the Whole Fiasco - Mental Health & Recovery","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"致整场惨败的所有受害者--心理健康与康复","the_new_excerpt":"我只想把这个信息传达给所有的患者，花点时间来谈谈。\n抛出的负面情绪和潜在的心理健康危机，即\n可以为这里的很多人展开。\n\n我知道一般人的情绪是对所有的人用负面的情绪来拉屎\n\"你应该卖掉的时候...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"致整場慘敗的所有受害者--心理健康與康復","the_new_excerpt":"我只想把這個信息傳達給所有的患者，花點時間來談談。\n拋出的負面情緒和潛在的心理健康危機，即\n可以爲這裏的很多人展開。\n\n我知道一般人的情緒是對所有的人用負面的情緒來拉屎\n\"你應該賣掉的時候...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l48ymg","previousId":"RedditPost-lc7lmb","nextId":"RedditPost-lcuiaj","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l48ymg/question_for_the_seasoned_investors_here_this/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
