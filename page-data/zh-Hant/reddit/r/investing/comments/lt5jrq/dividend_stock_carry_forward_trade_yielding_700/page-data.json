Please let me know your honest feedback and any big issues you see with this.   </p>\n\n<p>So here is the trade: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I took out a $500k margin loan at Interactive Brokers (“IB”) </li>\n<li>The interest rate is roughly 1.25% (yes, that is correct, 1.25%) </li>\n<li>I used the proceeds from the margin loan to purchase $500k in ETV (Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunities Fund) which is a Closed-End Fund </li>\n<li>My purchase price in ETV is $14.80 </li>\n<li>The fund pays a monthly dividend of $0.1108, which equates to a 9.0% yield </li>\n<li>The interest on the margin loan is ~$520/month </li>\n<li>The dividend income is $3,743/month </li>\n<li>This nets me $3,223 in income </li>\n<li>Now most of the dividend payment is classified as ROC (“return of capital”), which means it is not taxed (more <a href=\"https://funds.eatonvance.com/media/2551.pdf\">here</a> on how this works) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So here are the pro’s and con’s of this trade:   </p>\n\n<p>Pro’s </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Incredible return</strong> - I’m making ~7x my borrowing costs on this trade ($3,743 / $520  = 720% return) </li>\n<li><strong>Passive income</strong> - I would categorize this as a “set it and forget it” strategy as the income is completely passive; all you need to do is monitor the ETV dividend and stock price each month </li>\n<li><strong>Tax efficient</strong> - because most of the dividend payment is classified at “ROC”, the majority of the dividend payment is not taxed at all </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Con’s </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Margin Call</strong> - If there is a sudden drop in ETV’s value or if IB changes their margin requirements there will be a margin call. To mitigate this, I have only taken a margin position where a 50% drop in the security will require a margin call. I can’t do anything about IB changing it’s margin requirements. </li>\n<li><strong>Margin Loan Rate Changes</strong> - This rate is variable and can change at any time. Because IB margin loan rates are based on the Fed Funds rate, this is likely to go higher in the future (as we have historically low rates today). Looking at the fed funds rate <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart\">over the past 20 years</a>, they have been as high as 4%-5%.  However, even if the margin loan rates go to 4% the return is still 200%. Also, IB has never had rates this high as far as I can tell. </li>\n<li><strong>ETV share price can fall</strong> - ETV stock price can fluctuate up and down; given the volatile stock market this is a big unknown; if you look at ETV’s performance since inception (June 2005) the stock is down 1.9% annually.  What got me comfortable is I ran a few scenarios and if ETV’s stock price drops 3%/year for the next 5 years, the return is still 478% </li>\n<li><strong>ETV can cut their dividend</strong> - There is no guarantee that ETV will continue to pay a dividend; the last time they cut their dividend was in Sept 2010 (a 17% cut), but it has been steady ever since. I ran scenarios and even if there is a 22% cut in their dividend the return is 547% </li>\n<li><strong>Worst Case Scenario Can Happen</strong> - Suppose IB raises its margin loan rates to 4%, ETV’s stock price drops 3%/year AND they cut their dividend by 22%. I would consider this the doomsday scenario. Even if that happens, the return on this trade is 100% </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would love to hear this group’s opinions on this. I used this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TbnLYuqJAN1E_uv8_Tlxeyp3D5Bi83F-gdE2MQ_cGA0/edit?usp=sharing\">spreadsheet</a> to run the scenarios. I’m sure I have not thought about all the angles on this. Thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lt5jrq/dividend_stock_carry_forward_trade_yielding_700/","title":"Dividend Stock Carry Forward Trade (yielding ~700% return)","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-26T22:00:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-26 22:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lt5jrq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lt5jrq/dividend_stock_carry_forward_trade_yielding_700/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lt5jrq/dividend_stock_carry_forward_trade_yielding_700/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ESI192","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ESI192","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ESI192","score":185,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"红利股结转交易（收益率约700%）。","the_new_excerpt":"本着创造税收效率的被动收入的精神，我执行了一个。\n红利股结转交易(基本上是利用保证金贷款购买)\n红利股赚差价的钱）。)  我想得到这个群体的\n对该策略的看法。请让我知道你的真实反馈... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"紅利股結轉交易（收益率約700%）。","the_new_excerpt":"本着創造稅收效率的被動收入的精神，我執行了一個。\n紅利股結轉交易(基本上是利用保證金貸款購買)\n紅利股賺差價的錢）。)  我想得到這個羣體的\n對該策略的看法。請讓我知道你的真實反饋... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m3oztq","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3oztq/dfv_and_the_trade_of_destiny/","title":"DFV and the Trade of Destiny","date":"March 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"DFV和命运贸易","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"DFV和命運貿易","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m3v0po","excerpt":"Penn gaming is being added to the S&P500 later this month, after experiencing a\nmeteoric rise from extreme lows last March.
