So, we went into the 1920s with tremendous pent-up demand once the crisis ended, and balance sheets were in far greater shape. Government debt-to-GDP was 10 per cent — not over 100%. And that better public sector balance sheet allowed the federal government to CUT taxes by the mid-1920s — top marginal rates for corporations were initially raised from 10 per cent in 1920 to 13.5 per cent by 1926 but cut to 11 per cent by the end of the decade; for individuals, the rate went from 58 per cent after the war to 24 per cent by 1929. Does anyone think taxes are going to be coming down in the US any time soon?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tl;dr:</strong> There are major differences between the end of this pandemic and the end of the Spanish flu, notably business productivity, capital allocation, tax rates, starting valuations of the stock market, demographics and especially government debt levels. We are unlikely to see a repeat of the roaring 20s this decade. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional lesson:</strong> When multiple mainstream business publications are pushing the same narrative on their covers it often pays to go the other way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m3hkd2/david_rosenberg_says_there_will_be_no_roaring_20s/","title":"David Rosenberg says there will be no Roaring 20s, little inflation","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-12T18:59:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-12 18:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m3hkd2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m3hkd2/david_rosenberg_says_there_will_be_no_roaring_20s/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m3hkd2/david_rosenberg_says_there_will_be_no_roaring_20s/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Suspicious_Tension82","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Suspicious_Tension82","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Suspicious_Tension82","score":1288,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"大卫-罗森伯格说，不会有轰轰烈烈的20年代，几乎没有通货膨胀。","the_new_excerpt":"大卫-罗森博格的对立面研究笔记的一个很好的例子。\n[https://site.rosenbergresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Free-Special...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"大衛-羅森伯格說，不會有轟轟烈烈的20年代，幾乎沒有通貨膨脹。","the_new_excerpt":"大衛-羅森博格的對立面研究筆記的一個很好的例子。\n[https://site.rosenbergresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Free-Special...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mg6bjp","excerpt":"VW accidentally leaks new name for its U.S. operations: Voltswagen\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html]\n\nExcerpt:\n\n> The release said the name change “is expected to take effect in May” and\n> called the change a “public declaration of…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mg6bjp/news_on_name_change_leak_for_the_next_tesla/","title":"News on Name Change Leak for the Next Tesla: Voltswagen (VOW, VWAGY)","date":"March 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"关于下一款特斯拉改名的消息泄露。大众汽车（VOW，VWAGY)","the_new_excerpt":"大众意外泄露了其美国业务的新名称。Voltswagen\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html]\n\n摘录\n\n> 发布会上说，更名 \"预计将于5月生效\"，并且\n> 称为 \"公开声明的改变...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於下一款特斯拉改名的消息泄露。大衆汽車（VOW，VWAGY)","the_new_excerpt":"大衆意外泄露了其美國業務的新名稱。Voltswagen\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html]\n\n摘錄\n\n> 發佈會上說，更名 \"預計將於5月生效\"，並且\n> 稱爲 \"公開聲明的改變...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mg91ws","excerpt":"Choi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according\nto an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been\nreviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership.…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mg91ws/tesla_and_toyota_are_considering_jointly/","title":"Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV Platform","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 30, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"特斯拉和丰田正考虑联合开发小型电动SUV平台","the_new_excerpt":"崔元锡在韩国《高顺立博》新闻刊物上报道称，据。\n对日本汽车行业的一位官员来说，丰田和特斯拉已经被。\n从去年开始审查合作关系，目前已接近最后阶段。\n\n以下是丰田特斯拉合作的一些亮点....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉和豐田正考慮聯合開發小型電動SUV平臺","the_new_excerpt":"崔元錫在韓國《高順立博》新聞刊物上報道稱，據。\n對日本汽車行業的一位官員來說，豐田和特斯拉已經被。\n從去年開始審查合作關係，目前已接近最後階段。\n\n以下是豐田特斯拉合作的一些亮點....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m3hkd2","previousId":"RedditPost-mg6bjp","nextId":"RedditPost-mg91ws","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m3hkd2/david_rosenberg_says_there_will_be_no_roaring_20s/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
