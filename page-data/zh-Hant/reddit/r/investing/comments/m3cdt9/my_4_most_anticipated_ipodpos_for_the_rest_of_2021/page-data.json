These days I look at the recent IPO filings on Nasdaq.com and all I see is a sea of SPAC haha.</p>\n\n<p>I made a list in December of 2020 and with Roblox crossed off after their recent IPO I thought I&#39;d share the next 4 in line and see if anybody wanted to share theirs as well. In addition to the unicorns, there are a ton of companies with potential out there that most people aren&#39;t too familiar with, so if you think you&#39;ve got a 3, 5, or even 10 bagger then drop your names below!</p>\n\n<p>Mine are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>1.Applovin</p>\n\n<p>1.45B revenue in 2020. Basically a company that helps app developers promote their app, acquire users, and monetize their app. Growing at a fast pace and has achieved profitability every year except for 2020 due to aggressive content acquisition and expansion. </p>\n\n<p>2.Vizio</p>\n\n<p>2B revenue in 2020. This company is a household name and doesn&#39;t have the flashy revenue growth as other tech companies that are recently IPO-ing. But the idea that this company is going for is that they hope to model themselves after ROKU. They have a very high quality SmartTV OS and TV manufacturing line that is already vertically integrated, and they hope to expand by monetizing their Vizio SmartTV OS the same way Roku does- basically by SVOD, advertising, and selling user data. We&#39;ll see if it can catch ROKU in this market segment. </p>\n\n<p>3.Nextdoor</p>\n\n<p>Just going out on a limb but I think COVID helped people who normally ignore their neighbors get to know them a bit better. Especially if you live in a condo/apartment or whatever. Nextdoor is a nifty app that lets people connect with their physical neighbors and communities, and I think COVID was just the right catalyst for them to take off. There&#39;s not much on this company that I could find regarding their financials unfortunately, but apparently at their last funding round in late 2019 they were valued at 2B, and apparently are looking for a valuation of maybe 5B in 2021. </p>\n\n<p>I am bullish though as Sarah Friar is heading Nextdoor. CFO of Square, Senior VP at Salesforce, and served on the Board of Directors of Walmart and Slack. Banking background. Very confident in her abilities to drive the vision of the company forward. </p>\n\n<p>4.This one was tough, but I think Olo is a great high upside pick. Olo builds the software and platform that connects restaurants to users. Notable brands that use them include the Cheesecake Factory, Shake Shack, Wingstop, and Dennys. They can help build apps, order tracking software, and delivery coordination platforms for restaurants. </p>\n\n<p>There are some more high profile ones like Databricks, UIPath, Coinbase, Robinhood, and Instacart that aren&#39;t listed above but I wanted to share some lesser known ones that I&#39;m personally bullish on and probably won&#39;t get as much attention.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m3cdt9/my_4_most_anticipated_ipodpos_for_the_rest_of_2021/","title":"My 4 most anticipated IPO/DPO's for the rest of 2021","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-12T14:40:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-12 14:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m3cdt9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m3cdt9/my_4_most_anticipated_ipodpos_for_the_rest_of_2021/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m3cdt9/my_4_most_anticipated_ipodpos_for_the_rest_of_2021/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"eddyjqt5","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/eddyjqt5","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"eddyjqt5","score":133,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"2021年剩下的时间里，我最期待的4个IPO/DPO。","the_new_excerpt":"新的公司上市总是令人兴奋的，我一般都会尽量跟踪以下信息\n任何围绕独角兽的大新闻。这些天，我看了最近的IPO申请书。\n在纳斯达克网站上，我看到的是一片SPAC的海洋，哈哈。\n\n我在2020年12月做了一个名单，在Roblox最近被划掉后，他们的名单也被划掉了。\nIPO一...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年剩下的時間裏，我最期待的4個IPO/DPO。","the_new_excerpt":"新的公司上市總是令人興奮的，我一般都會盡量跟蹤以下信息\n任何圍繞獨角獸的大新聞。這些天，我看了最近的IPO申請書。\n在納斯達克網站上，我看到的是一片SPAC的海洋，哈哈。\n\n我在2020年12月做了一個名單，在Roblox最近被劃掉後，他們的名單也被劃掉了。\nIPO一...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mfw9bs","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfw9bs/morgan_stanley_has_no_more_rkt_blocks_to_sell_lol/","title":"Morgan Stanley has no more RKT blocks to sell LOL","date":"March 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"摩根士丹利没有更多的RKT块出售LOL。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"摩根士丹利沒有更多的RKT塊出售LOL。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mfv5xc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfv5xc/lets_go_to_the_moon_boys/","title":"Let’s go to the moon boys!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 30, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我们去月球吧！","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們去月球吧！","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m3cdt9","previousId":"RedditPost-mfw9bs","nextId":"RedditPost-mfv5xc","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m3cdt9/my_4_most_anticipated_ipodpos_for_the_rest_of_2021/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
