Joel Greenblatt, called &quot;Is It Different This Time?&quot; (google it if you haven&#39;t, its fantastic) and one of  Joel&#39;s talking points about the euphoria we&#39;ve reached in the stock markets is that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>He took the 100 least profitable companies in 2019 (pre-covid)</li>\n<li>As of early 2021 all 100 companies have posted a 100% return\n\n<ul>\n<li>(Share price at end of 2019 -  Share price End of January 2021) / (Share price at end of 2019)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I thought that statement was bonkers, so I took a list of NYSE + NASDAQ companies ~ 6500, excluded SPACs/warrants and anything that through an error in google sheets (lazy I know), which left around 5000 equities.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Of the 5,000 equities, Over 3,130 have posted a &gt;100% return from their 52 week low</li>\n<li>Of the 5,000 equities, Over 500 have posted a &gt;500% return from their 52 week low</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So I try to rationalize these as buying opportunities as a result from COVID but when I filter the 5,000 equities to only include companies w/ a TTM EPS of &lt;0, I am left with 2,500**.**</p>\n\n<p><strong>2,500 unprofitable publicly traded companies.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So 2,500, or ~50% of the total universe of equities on NYSE + NASDAQ, over a 12 month window, have not been profitable (as defined by TTM EPS &lt;0).</p>\n\n<p>What blows my mind is of these 2,500 &quot;unprofitable companies&quot; :</p>\n\n<h1>1,795 have had a &gt;100% return from their 52 week low</h1>\n\n<h1>500 of the  have had a &gt;50% return YTD</h1>\n\n<p>WTF?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>50% of all publicly traded NASDAQ/NYSE companies are not profitable\n\n<ul>\n<li>Filter 1 = only list equities where TTM EPS &lt;0</li>\n<li>Result = 2500</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Yet 35% have posted a 100% return from their 52 week low\n\n<ul>\n<li>Filter 1  = only list equities where TTM EPS &lt;0</li>\n<li>Filter 2 = Filter 1 +  only list equities where ((current price - 52weeklow)/52weeklow) &gt;

 in 2021</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I would love to get feedback from the community at large, especially from the contrarians and old timers. Also, if one were to &quot;capitalize on a major correction in the next 12 months&quot; what would you recommend?
