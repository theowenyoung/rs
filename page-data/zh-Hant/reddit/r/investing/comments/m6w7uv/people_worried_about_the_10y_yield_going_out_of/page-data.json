While technically this might be possible, consider the fact that China just had a record $ 100 Billion trade surplus two months vs the US.</p>\n\n<p>To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html</a></p>\n\n<p>So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.</p>\n\n<p>3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.</p>\n\n<p>Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed&#39;s &quot;operation twist&quot; might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]</p>\n\n<p>4) Also, while &quot;inflation expectations&quot; have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I&#39;m not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m6w7uv/people_worried_about_the_10y_yield_going_out_of/","title":"People worried about the 10y yield going out of control should recognise some things.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T12:59:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 12:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m6w7uv","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m6w7uv/people_worried_about_the_10y_yield_going_out_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m6w7uv/people_worried_about_the_10y_yield_going_out_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"GabenFanClub","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GabenFanClub","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"GabenFanClub","score":312,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"担心10y收益率失控的人应该认清一些事情。","the_new_excerpt":"在我看来\n\n1）收益率已经开始成为吸引国外主要买家的因素。\n日本机构是最大的国外买家，并且在持续增发。\n更多。\n\ninvesting.com/news/economic-indicators/foreigners-raise holdings-ofus-treasuries for second month in January-data...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"擔心10y收益率失控的人應該認清一些事情。","the_new_excerpt":"在我看來\n\n1）收益率已經開始成爲吸引國外主要買家的因素。\n日本機構是最大的國外買家，並且在持續增發。\n更多。\n\ninvesting.com/news/economic-indicators/foreigners-raise holdings-ofus-treasuries for second month in January-data...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mlbjdv","excerpt":"So it's simple what's your highest conviction stocks\n\nSo to start of my highest conviction stocks has to be Berkshire Hathaway,\nFacebook, Amazon, Google and Unilever Here's why I like these in short\n\nSo I like Berkshire Hathaway because of warren buffet and Charlie munger but\nalso this is a…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mlbjdv/what_are_your_highest_conviction_picks/","title":"What are your highest conviction picks","date":"April 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"あなたの最も高い信念のあるピックは何ですか？","the_new_excerpt":"つまり、あなたが最も確信を持っている銘柄は何かということです。\n\nまず、私が最も確信している銘柄は、バークシャー・ハサウェイです。\nフェイスブック、アマゾン、グーグル、ユニリーバ これらの銘柄が好きな理由を簡単に説明します。\n\nバークシャー・ハサウェイが好きなのは、ウォーレン・バッフェとチャーリー・マンガーがいるからです。\nまた、これは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你的最高信念选择是什么","the_new_excerpt":"所以很简单，你信念最高的股票是什么？\n\n所以开始我信念最高的股票必须是伯克希尔哈撒韦。\nFacebook、亚马逊、谷歌和联合利华 简而言之，我喜欢这些的原因是什么？\n\n所以我喜欢伯克希尔哈撒韦是因为沃伦-巴菲特和查理-芒格，但是... ...\n这也是一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你的最高信念選擇是什麼","the_new_excerpt":"所以很簡單，你信念最高的股票是什麼？\n\n所以開始我信念最高的股票必須是伯克希爾哈撒韋。\nFacebook、亞馬遜、谷歌和聯合利華 簡而言之，我喜歡這些的原因是什麼？\n\n所以我喜歡伯克希爾哈撒韋是因爲沃倫-巴菲特和查理-芒格，但是... ...\n這也是一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mlltn1","excerpt":"https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2021/Coinbase-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Estimated-Results-and-Full-Year-2021-Outlook/default.aspx\n\n\n\n> For the first quarter of 2021, the Company currently expects the following as\n> of or for the three months ended March 31, 2021:\n> \n> Verified…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mlltn1/coinbase_announces_first_quarter_2021_estimated/","title":"Coinbase Announces First Quarter 2021 Estimated Results","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 07, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"コインベース、2021年第1四半期の推定業績を発表","the_new_excerpt":"https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2021/Coinbase-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Estimated-Results-and-Full-Year-2021-Outlook/default.aspx\n\n\n\n> 2021年第1四半期について、当社は現時点で以下のように見込んでいます。\n> 2021年3月31日に終了した3ヵ月間のうちに、または3ヵ月間のうちに。\n> \n> 検証された...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Coinbase公布2021年第一季度预估财报","the_new_excerpt":"https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2021/Coinbase-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Estimated-Results-and-Full-Year-2021-Outlook/default.aspx\n\n\n\n>对于2021年一季度，公司目前预计如下： 1．\n> 截至2021年3月31日止的三个月，或在这三个月内。\n> \n> 已验证...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Coinbase公佈2021年第一季度預估財報","the_new_excerpt":"https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2021/Coinbase-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Estimated-Results-and-Full-Year-2021-Outlook/default.aspx\n\n\n\n>對於2021年一季度，公司目前預計如下： 1．\n> 截至2021年3月31日止的三個月，或在這三個月內。\n> \n> 已驗證...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m6w7uv","previousId":"RedditPost-mlbjdv","nextId":"RedditPost-mlltn1","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m6w7uv/people_worried_about_the_10y_yield_going_out_of/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
