Within the index, $NUMI (Numinus Wellness Inc) has 3x the share allocation vs. $MMED (MINDMED INC). $NUMI being the Canadian leader in the psychedelic space. $MMED being the lead player in the market with a $1.50B Market Cap vs. $NUMI at $250M. At 6x the market cap, I expect significant upside potential for $NUMI with the launch of the ETF. </p>\n\n<p>Overall I am very bullish on this ETF.
