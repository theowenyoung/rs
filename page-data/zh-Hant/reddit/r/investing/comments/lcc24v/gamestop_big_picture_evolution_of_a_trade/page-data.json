This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I&#39;m using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.</em></p>\n\n<p>So.. I mentioned possibly doing a &#39;post mortem&#39; on my GME trade, and apparently that was in high demand.  That being said, I&#39;ll call it an &#39;evolution&#39; instead, as we still don&#39;t yet know what will happen next.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than going through a full narrative, I made a <a href=\"https://u.teknik.io/xg2HJ.PNG\">crazy annotated chart</a> to chronicle some of the key points in my trade decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Strangely enough, I think it might better convey how the week went from my perspective a little better than a full narrative.  If you catch any inconsistencies between the chart, or my writing below, please point it out.  It&#39;s very easy to ex post facto ascribe to yourself the benefit of 20/20 foresight and overlook mistakes you made at the time.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll walk through my thought process for newer traders.  Keep in mind I&#39;m trading my hobby account, not a self-directed IRA, so the stakes are a lot lower and tolerance for risk is much higher:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I would probably trace the initial origins of this trade for me back to November.  I wasn&#39;t a genius like DFV finding GME at that point, but once the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine efficacy data came out, I decided to go rummaging through XRT (retail)  and other unloved sectors for value that should rebound on the sector rotation to the &#39;reopening trade&#39; given the nosebleed multiples in QQQ (the NASDAQ/big tech companies that dominated the market in 2020).  Figured I&#39;d mostly ride the SMH (semiconductor index) and a few other favorites while digging around.  Looking at unloved sectors is the value/long term investor version of &#39;buy the dip&#39; (typically the dip might last years, but I figured in this case the evolution would be much faster because it would be driven by progress against COVID).</li>\n<li>ID&#39;d GME for the short list because of an unusually regular pattern on the daily chart RSI.  In hindsight I would probably attribute that to one of the hedge funds trying to stealthily unwind its short position veeeeery slowly, but GME being a dead corner of the market, it shows up in the data like a lighthouse beacon, in a channel upward just bouncing off RSI 70.  Someone is gradually accumulating a big long position or covering a big short position.  TJX&#39;s looks better, but valuation too high already (over-loved).</li>\n<li>Deep dive DD, including DD from WSB just makes me think this is exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for.  Better buy in before it escapes completely.<br/></li>\n<li>Ok..it made some massive moves already, but with the bonus of the short interest anomaly this is too good..  and it comes with awesome memes--can&#39;t say no to the package deal. $38 (my first buy) is pretty good, but I&#39;ll write April $40 cash-secured puts to net me a better entry (or additional profit if they go unexercised).  This is a common technique investors can use to get either a better entry than they otherwise could get, or some participation in the upside if the price runs away--I find it easier to do this than setting an aggressively low GTC limit buy and keeping my fingers crossed.</li>\n<li>Digging deeper into the short squeeze thesis tells me it&#39;s practically mathematically guaranteed to go off any moment.  I take off some cash-secured puts, liquidate a lot of the rest of my portfolio, etc. because if things get as crazy as I think they might, it&#39;s better to have almost nothing else in your portfolio to complicate matters.  This is especially true as margin requirements start rising.</li>\n<li>Volatility starts going crazy.  You almost can&#39;t see it on the daily chart with the scaling of the 500+ peak, but if you focus on the 1/21 to 1/26 timeframe there were a few brutal Eiffel tower moves (parabolic up then down).  All kinds of misinformation about what is going on starts flying.  People start FOMOing into those moves only to despair out on the other side for a loss.  Few if any seem to be willing to talk about the situation in a way that newer traders can understand.  I start posting a bit here and there, just getting a feel for reddit.</li>\n<li>On 1/25 I see a few heated discussions regarding whether the gap up over the weekend, then crash down that day in fact WAS the squeeze, and I try to jump in and correct the record a bit.. people are panicking out on the downside of that move because they&#39;re being told the squeeze is over.  That motivates me to write my first article in the series.  Don&#39;t finish it that evening, decide to finish it in the morning.  It drops on this sub essentially as what we now know was the squeeze is achieving liftoff.</li>\n<li>Looking at my posts from 1/25 to 1/29, I&#39;m probably too tuned in to the hype, but tuning in to sentiment is important in sentiment-driven momentum trading.  I do try to consistently try to warn new traders from FOMOing in, but that doesn&#39;t stop me from trying to help them understand what is going on.</li>\n<li>One thing I&#39;ve learned the hard way--don&#39;t carry a sentiment-driven momentum trading position through a weekend.  That usually does not end well.</li>\n<li>The weekend gives me time to step back and resume a more analytical approach and you may notice my writing style reflects that at that point.  Looking back, I notice a lot of sloppiness and some outright errors in my realtime read of the situation.  I try to point some of those out if I feel they might be material to others&#39; trading decisions.</li>\n<li>At this point I&#39;m thinking the squeeze has been mostly squoze (but for a few &#39;technically it&#39;s still possible&#39; type scenarios).  I figure since so many of the regular readers/commentators on my posts are going to ride it, I&#39;ll keep a position on to ride it with them too.  We&#39;ll see where we go from here!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I actually did really well on the trade overall.  Could have done much better had I just stuck to my trades rather than reading and writing on Reddit, but the numerous comments I&#39;ve seen where I or other commentators in this sub were able to provide good, level-headed feedback and advice helped people make better decisions make it worthwhile to me.  I guess it just bothered me too much to see the vacuum of real information and willingness of people to push their trade on others.  I didn&#39;t see that kind of behavior in WSB even just the week prior when I first joined.</p>\n\n<p>Also, while it turned out very well, I have to be completely intellectually honest and admit that I could have lost it all too.  This was a crazy volatile trade with more twists and turns and unexpected developments than I could have imagined, and that&#39;s even given that I actually believe it when I say that I don&#39;t know what will happen next.  This is something anyone knowingly walking into this type of situation should realize and plan for.</p>\n\n<p>Each person has a different tolerance for risk, though I will say that while I was and am willing to take significant risks with my hobby trading account, I try to never take entirely irrational risks.  I also actively put at risk a relatively small percent of even my hobby trading capital (~20%).  It may not seem like it, as you&#39;ve seen my writing on a high volatility play, but my overall capital disposition is very conservative and low-risk/low-volatility in aggregate.  It&#39;s because I know that most of it is safe that I can feel comfortable and controlled making very high risk plays.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen people put it all on the line and totally clutch trade big momentum--I wish I could, but I know that&#39;s not me.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few sayings that traders have as almost jokes, but with an undercurrent of dark humor in many cases:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Rule #1: never lose money.</strong> From Warren Buffett, value investing legend.  I&#39;m a little more flexible with this for myself, and amend it to &quot;always have a plan that guarantees you can never lose more money than you intended to put at risk.&quot;  If you are in the red on this trade, realized or unrealized, don&#39;t feel bad--I&#39;m very confident that most people are in the same boat.  Try to think of it as tuition for one of the most intense, and hopefully intellectually productive seminars ever, held only once every decade or so.</li>\n<li><strong>No one ever went bankrupt taking profit, or pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.</strong> (counterpoint: tons of people have gone essentially bankrupt riding profits right back into the ground--particularly in climactic late bubble market action, like the dotcom bubble).  To those of you feeling bad that you could have made more, be glad that you were in the green.  It&#39;s something to celebrate.  You traded a black swan event and came out ahead.</li>\n<li><strong>Buy low, sell high.</strong>  MUCH harder to do consistently than it seems.  Particularly if you initiate a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5l413/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity/gkyxdqv/?context=3\">trade from FOMO</a>.  For those of you who did this, try to remember what that was like, and think of ways you can manage those emotions in the future, or ensure you never put yourself in a similar position if you&#39;d rather not have to.  Either approach will be healthier for both you and your wallet in the long run.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Alright, this post is long enough as is.  We&#39;ll see where the rocket takes us tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck in the market!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcc24v/gamestop_big_picture_evolution_of_a_trade/","title":"Gamestop Big Picture: Evolution of a Trade","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T15:42:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 15:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcc24v","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcc24v/gamestop_big_picture_evolution_of_a_trade/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcc24v/gamestop_big_picture_evolution_of_a_trade/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"jn_ku","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jn_ku","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jn_ku","score":508,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Gamestop大图片。贸易的演变","the_new_excerpt":"免责声明：我不是财务顾问。整篇文章仅代表我\n个人观点和意见，不应视为财务建议（或）。\n任何形式的建议）。) 我鼓励你做自己的研究，采取必要的措施。\n我写的任何东西都要小心翼翼，并让我对任何... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Gamestop大圖片。貿易的演變","the_new_excerpt":"免責聲明：我不是財務顧問。整篇文章僅代表我\n個人觀點和意見，不應視爲財務建議（或）。\n任何形式的建議）。) 我鼓勵你做自己的研究，採取必要的措施。\n我寫的任何東西都要小心翼翼，並讓我對任何... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ll0bwn","excerpt":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-tesla-bubble-bursts-catastrophe-wont-follow-11613221203\n\n * The excess in today’s story stocks—electric cars, clean power and cannabis in\n   particular—surely poses a threat to the wealth of their shareholders.
