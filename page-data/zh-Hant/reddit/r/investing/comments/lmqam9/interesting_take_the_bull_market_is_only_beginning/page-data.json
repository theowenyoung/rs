I began hoarding cash anticipating a drop and a recession that could last years and depress stock prices.</p>\n\n<p>Until I sat in one of my classes and my professor, a CMT, brought up an interesting point: we might only be at the start of the bull market. He brought up the classic SPX chart showing the enormous returns ever since the &#39;08 recession. Then he brought out other indices such as the Russell 2000 (IWM) and various Emerging Market ETFs (VEA, IEFA, AIA, etc.) and pointed out an oddity: Between 2018 and March 2020, these markets have been stagnant/flat, essentially trading within a range. He explained that while growth in the S&amp;P might have been great the last few years, practically the rest of the world lagged behind.</p>\n\n<p>Basically his point was this: now that all of these other indices/stocks are joining the rally after being stagnant for years, the real bull market is just beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, he and I could easily be wrong. But I was interested in finding out your thoughts on this, what do you guys think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lmqam9/interesting_take_the_bull_market_is_only_beginning/","title":"Interesting Take: The Bull Market is Only Beginning","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-18T20:13:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-18 20:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lmqam9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lmqam9/interesting_take_the_bull_market_is_only_beginning/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lmqam9/interesting_take_the_bull_market_is_only_beginning/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Misofire","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Misofire","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Misofire","score":473,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"有趣的观点：牛市才刚刚开始","the_new_excerpt":"和你们很多人一样，我也认为，不久的某一天，我们长达10年的牛市一定会出现。\n结束。我开始囤积现金，期待下跌和可能持续的经济衰退。\n年，并打压股价。\n\n直到我坐在我的一节课上，我的教授，一个CMT，提出了一个。\n有趣的是：我们可能只是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有趣的觀點：牛市纔剛剛開始","the_new_excerpt":"和你們很多人一樣，我也認爲，不久的某一天，我們長達10年的牛市一定會出現。\n結束。我開始囤積現金，期待下跌和可能持續的經濟衰退。\n年，並打壓股價。\n\n直到我坐在我的一節課上，我的教授，一個CMT，提出了一個。\n有趣的是：我們可能只是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lxcwuj","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxcwuj/amc_cinemark_reopening_select_bay_area_theaters/","title":"AMC, Cinemark reopening select Bay Area theaters this Friday 💎💎💎💎💰💰💰","date":"March 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"AMC、Cinemark本周五重开湾区部分影院💎💎💎💎💰💰。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMC、Cinemark本週五重開灣區部分影院💎💎💎💎💰💰。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lx0ls8","excerpt":"EDIT: Based on the fact that a number of comments seem to have been made without\nreading beyond the first 9 words of the title, and the fact that this is sitting\nat 60% upvoted, I'd encourage you to at least read to the TLDR.\n\nI usually stick to providing raw data, but this post has a little bit of…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx0ls8/rkt_is_being_pushed_as_a_distraction_from_gme_a/","title":"\"RKT is being pushed as a distraction from GME\": a quantitative analysis","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 04, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"\"RKT被推崇为分散GME的注意力\"：定量分析。","the_new_excerpt":"编辑：基于一些评论似乎没有被提出。\n阅读超过标题的前9个字，以及事实上，这是在坐。\n在60%的上票，我鼓励你至少读到TLDR。\n\n我通常坚持提供原始数据，但这篇文章有一点... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"RKT被推崇爲分散GME的注意力\"：定量分析。","the_new_excerpt":"編輯：基於一些評論似乎沒有被提出。\n閱讀超過標題的前9個字，以及事實上，這是在坐。\n在60%的上票，我鼓勵你至少讀到TLDR。\n\n我通常堅持提供原始數據，但這篇文章有一點... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lmqam9","previousId":"RedditPost-lxcwuj","nextId":"RedditPost-lx0ls8","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lmqam9/interesting_take_the_bull_market_is_only_beginning/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
