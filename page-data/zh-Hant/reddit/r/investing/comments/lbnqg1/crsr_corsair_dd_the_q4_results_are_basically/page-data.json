[…] These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy, and they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do: They looked”.</em> (Big Short)</p>\n\n<p>I have seen many good quality DD about Corsair. We all know it’s a great business. </p>\n\n<p>What I want to focus on is the financials. More specifically: <strong>We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it! Why? Because nobody looked!!!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Corsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of 7.5M shares by some insiders (totally normal as it’s mostly the private equity owner – EagleTree - selling a small bit and passing from 78.32% to 68.55% ownership - they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold… It’s totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit). </p>\n\n<p>Here’s the <strong>prospectus (dated 21st of January 2021</strong>): <a href=\"https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33\">https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33</a> </p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Now, check out page 9 of the document </p>\n\n<p><strong>For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million</strong>   </p>\n\n<p>Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the company initially estimated the following (<em>from Q3 release</em> <a href=\"https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d\">https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d</a>)</p>\n\n<p>For the full year 2020, we currently expect: </p>\n\n<p>• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.</p>\n\n<p>• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million. </p>\n\n<p>• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.  </p>\n\n<p>Then, they updated the <em>guidance on November 30th 2020</em> (<a href=\"https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook\">https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook</a>): </p>\n\n<p>For the full year 2020, we currently expect:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.</li>\n<li>Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.</li>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look). </p>\n\n<p>As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.</p>\n\n<p>In the more recent prospectus (page 10): </p>\n\n<p><em>In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.</em>   </p>\n\n<p><strong>This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.</strong> As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So <strong>this implies around 150M FCF in 2020</strong> (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M). </p>\n\n<p>(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here <a href=\"https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d\">https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d</a>)</p>\n\n<p>At $39, Corsair has a 3.5Bn market cap (91.92M of shares outstanding).</p>\n\n<p>This is a very respectable cash flow yield of 4.2%. I’d be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (60.7% growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of 69.4% in Q4).</p>\n\n<p>-----</p>\n\n<p>Now, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!</p>\n\n<p>I used to be like you… I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things! </p>\n\n<p>No f*** way!!!</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at Goldman Sachs’ research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published). </p>\n\n<p>Someone shared it on reddit</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nrmzjy9lw3f61.png?width=4129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c3bf8e1c1308a15dbbb26b519c58a4d7dea8ab0\">https://preview.redd.it/nrmzjy9lw3f61.png?width=4129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c3bf8e1c1308a15dbbb26b519c58a4d7dea8ab0</a></p>\n\n<p>They still base themselves on the updated guidance of November 30th 2020. No mention whatsoever of the much more recently updated “guidance” (more than a guidance, it’s actually the results given how close the ranges are…)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Corsair is a great company and its results are already out! </p>\n\n<p>Make your own investment decisions!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lbnqg1/crsr_corsair_dd_the_q4_results_are_basically/","title":"$CRSR Corsair DD - The Q4 results are basically already out and nobody is talking about it!","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T15:32:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 15:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lbnqg1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbnqg1/crsr_corsair_dd_the_q4_results_are_basically/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbnqg1/crsr_corsair_dd_the_q4_results_are_basically/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"unreasonableinv","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/unreasonableinv","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"unreasonableinv","score":2950,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"\"当整个世界都在进行一场盛大的老式聚会时，一些外来者和怪人\n看到了别人看不到的东西。[...]这些外人看到了巨大的谎言在心脏的位置\n的经济，他们看到了这一点，通过做一些其余的吸盘从来没有。\n想到要做。他们看着\"。(《大空头》)\n\n我见过很多...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"\"當整個世界都在進行一場盛大的老式聚會時，一些外來者和怪人\n看到了別人看不到的東西。[...]這些外人看到了巨大的謊言在心臟的位置\n的經濟，他們看到了這一點，通過做一些其餘的吸盤從來沒有。\n想到要做。他們看着\"。(《大空頭》)\n\n我見過很多...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lk0mld","excerpt":"> The world can destroy your body, but only your mind can destroy your soul.\n\nI want you to do me a favor.
