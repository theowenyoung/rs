This idea to me does not flow with the idea that most investors demand at least some type of safety or risk aversion with their investment choices. </p>\n\n<p>Lower interest rates, easy money, and simply no where else to put that money to gain a return, won&#39;t last forever. Sure, up until some given point (and that is the key) investors will flock to the only option available for returns. However, in my opinion, that level will slowly wane as the market rises along with the risk associated with it at these price levels. I don&#39;t believe investors will continue to put their money to work in a market that (at these price levels) only brings a higher level of risk with it. At some point money will stay on the sidelines. </p>\n\n<p>Low interest rates just might cut it as a qualifying reasoning for the current valuations, but they won&#39;t be the reasoning for a correction/recession if it occurs and stays. </p>\n\n<p>Low interest rates that fueled this IMO excessive market rally will eventually be named the cause of the eventual correction. At that point whether money on the sidelines flows in will be dependent upon the economic/stimulus conditions at the time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kz5o83/opinion_lower_interest_rates_wont_justify/","title":"(Opinion) Lower interest rates won't justify excessive valuations forever.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-17T17:42:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-17 17:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kz5o83","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kz5o83/opinion_lower_interest_rates_wont_justify/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kz5o83/opinion_lower_interest_rates_wont_justify/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"superavg","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/superavg","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"superavg","score":173,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"观点）降息不会永远成为过度估值的理由。","the_new_excerpt":"我偏向于我们被高估的一面。\n\n似乎最近很多人对目前的市场价格给出的唯一理由就是\n是低利率。在我看来，这种想法并不符合这样的想法。\n大多数投资者要求至少有一定的安全性或风险规避与... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"觀點）降息不會永遠成爲過度估值的理由。","the_new_excerpt":"我偏向於我們被高估的一面。\n\n似乎最近很多人對目前的市場價格給出的唯一理由就是\n是低利率。在我看來，這種想法並不符合這樣的想法。\n大多數投資者要求至少有一定的安全性或風險規避與... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l8mzow","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8mzow/welcome_to_the_endgame/","title":"Welcome to the Endgame.","date":"January 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"欢迎来到 \"终局\"。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"歡迎來到 \"終局\"。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l8n2uo","excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/tesla-service-now-includes-collision-repairs.html\n\nTesla notified customers on Friday that the company’s service centers will now\noffer collision repairs, something CEO Elon Musk had been talking about since\n2018.\n\nTesla reported $678 million from a combined Services…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l8n2uo/tesla_service_now_includes_collision_repairs/","title":"Tesla service now includes collision repairs, fulfilling Elon Musk’s 2018 promise","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 30, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"特斯拉服务现在包括碰撞维修，实现了埃隆-马斯克2018年的承诺。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/tesla-service-now-includes-collision-repairs.html\n\n特斯拉上周五通知客户，该公司的服务中心现在将。\n提供碰撞维修，这是首席执行官埃隆-马斯克自以来一直在谈论的事情。\n2018.\n\n特斯拉报告6.78亿美元，从合并后的服务...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉服務現在包括碰撞維修，實現了埃隆-馬斯克2018年的承諾。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/tesla-service-now-includes-collision-repairs.html\n\n特斯拉上週五通知客戶，該公司的服務中心現在將。\n提供碰撞維修，這是首席執行官埃隆-馬斯克自以來一直在談論的事情。\n2018.\n\n特斯拉報告6.78億美元，從合併後的服務...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kz5o83","previousId":"RedditPost-l8mzow","nextId":"RedditPost-l8n2uo","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kz5o83/opinion_lower_interest_rates_wont_justify/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
