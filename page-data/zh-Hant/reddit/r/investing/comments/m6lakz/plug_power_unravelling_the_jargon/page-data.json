Here is my stab... the stuff in brackets is my deciphering attempt.</p>\n\n<p>Company:\nAdjustments on the balance sheets to reduce the carrying amount of certain right of use assets and finance obligations associated with leases.... </p>\n\n<p>(Overestimated the value of the leases they have entered into. Reduction in size of assets and associated lease expense).  </p>\n\n<p> Company:\n·An increase in the loss accrual relating to certain service contracts;</p>\n\n<p>(Probably more serious that the above. They have mispriced service contracts and need to account for more losses as a result).<br/>\n </p>\n\n<p>Company:\n·Recognition of non-cash impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets, including certain right of use assets and certain fixed assets;</p>\n\n<p>(Probably the most serious. These assets being impaired are non-cash in nature now... but they would have been cash at some point, e.g. capex to build these assets. At its more nefarious... they paid money or provided capex to customers and they just aren&#39;t getting the benefits back).<br/>\n </p>\n\n<p>Company:\n·A reclassification of certain costs resulting in a decrease in Operating expenses - Research and development expense and a corresponding increase in Cost of revenue</p>\n\n<p>(Overestimated the gross margin, cost moving from development to cost of service. Therefore less tech spend... more manufacturing and service spend).</p>\n\n<p>....</p>\n\n<p>All in all seems pretty serious to me. That last set of accounts were a big red flag with negative revenue being delivered. In these situations its a good opportunity to scan the last set of accounts... see what  you could haven&#39;t learnt and what to watch out for.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m6lakz/plug_power_unravelling_the_jargon/","title":"Plug power - unravelling the jargon","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T05:41:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 05:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m6lakz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m6lakz/plug_power_unravelling_the_jargon/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m6lakz/plug_power_unravelling_the_jargon/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Mortal1ty1337","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mortal1ty1337","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Mortal1ty1337","score":62,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"插头电源--解读专业术语","the_new_excerpt":"我很喜欢解读管理层的废话，当他们有\n虚假账户（如果你拥有它，很抱歉）。下面是我的尝试......括号里的东西。\n是我的破译尝试。\n\n公司。在资产负债表上调整资产负债表，以减少资产负债表的账面金额。\n某些使用权资产和融资...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"插頭電源--解讀專業術語","the_new_excerpt":"我很喜歡解讀管理層的廢話，當他們有\n虛假賬戶（如果你擁有它，很抱歉）。下面是我的嘗試......括號裏的東西。\n是我的破譯嘗試。\n\n公司。在資產負債表上調整資產負債表，以減少資產負債表的賬面金額。\n某些使用權資產和融資...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1379346893612929025","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1379346893612929025","title":"Just handed in my notice period and will finally be able to work on Investment Talk as my sole endeavour from henceforth 🥂 \n\nhttps://t.co/v4sd4RAcyj","date":"April 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja-JA","full_text":"この度、退職届を提出し、今後は投資トークに専念することになりました🥂。\n\nhttps://t.co/v4sd4RAcyj","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"刚交了通知期，从今以后，我终于可以把《投资心语》作为我唯一的事业来做了🥂。\n\nhttps://t.co/v4sd4RAcyj","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"剛交了通知期，從今以後，我終於可以把《投資心語》作爲我唯一的事業來做了🥂。\n\nhttps://t.co/v4sd4RAcyj","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"ja","full_text":"この度、退職届を提出し、今後は投資トークに専念することになりました🥂。\n\nhttps://t.co/v4sd4RAcyj","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mlccw1","excerpt":"Fidelity Investments, Square Inc. and several other financial firms are forming\na new trade group that aims to shape the way bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\nare regulated.\n\nThe Crypto Council for Innovation will lobby policy makers, take up research\nprojects and serve as the burgeoning industry’s…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mlccw1/fidelity_square_coinbase_launch_bitcoin_trade/","title":"Fidelity, Square, Coinbase Launch Bitcoin Trade Group","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"フィデリティ、スクウェア、コインベースがビットコイン取引グループを設立","the_new_excerpt":"Fidelity Investments、Square Inc.をはじめとする複数の金融企業が形成する\nビットコインやその他の暗号通貨の規制方法の策定を目的とした新しい業界団体を設立しました。\nを設立しました。\n\nCrypto Council for Innovation（革新のための暗号協議会）は、政策立案者に働きかけ、研究プロジェクトを立ち上げ\nまた、急成長を遂げているこの業界のために...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Fidelity、Square、Coinbase成立比特币交易集团","the_new_excerpt":"富达投资公司、Square公司和其他几家金融公司正在组建。\n一个新的贸易集团，旨在塑造比特币和其他加密货币的方式。\n受到监管。\n\n加密创新委员会将游说政策制定者，承接研究。\n项目，并作为新兴产业的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Fidelity、Square、Coinbase成立比特幣交易集團","the_new_excerpt":"富達投資公司、Square公司和其他幾家金融公司正在組建。\n一個新的貿易集團，旨在塑造比特幣和其他加密貨幣的方式。\n受到監管。\n\n加密創新委員會將遊說政策制定者，承接研究。\n項目，並作爲新興產業的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m6lakz","previousId":"TweetPost-1379346893612929025","nextId":"RedditPost-mlccw1","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m6lakz/plug_power_unravelling_the_jargon/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
