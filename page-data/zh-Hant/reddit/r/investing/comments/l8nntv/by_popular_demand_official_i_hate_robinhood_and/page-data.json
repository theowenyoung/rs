In general I think everyone is best served by Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard.  TD is another major player but for those unaware they are in the process of being acquired by schwab.  All three of those actually have phone numbers where you can call and speak to a person about your account.</p>\n\n<p>For the younger crowd; a phone call is similar to voice to text, but instantaneous. </p>\n\n<p>Also, feel free to chat apps or whatever too,</p>\n\n<p>E: <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7t4pg/an_explanation_of_why_robinhoodapp_nonnefariously/\">here is an overview of what happened with Robinhood</a>.  No conspiracy theories or anything included, just a technical explanation. </p>\n\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/_/gl88dzj/?context=1\">my comment and subsequent conversation around liquidity concerns at Robinhood</a></p>\n\n<p>Please note - I don’t have any special insight here, this is strictly my and others interpretation of the tea leaves.  Feel free to discuss, and explore other interpretations.  Whatever broker choice you make is up to you, the important thing is that it is an educated choice since it’s ultimately your money. </p>\n\n<h1><strong>No referral codes.
