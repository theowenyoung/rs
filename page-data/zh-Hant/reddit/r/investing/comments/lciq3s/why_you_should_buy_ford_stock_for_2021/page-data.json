Car industry his whole life.  He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises.  This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now.  They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing.  I expect strong 2021 outlook.</p></li>\n<li><p>The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue.  Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands.  For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150.  They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands.  This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.</p></li>\n<li><p>They have 2 other extremely promising aspects.  First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans.  Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area.  The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal.  Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.  </p></li>\n<li><p>The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason.  Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good.  Most have looked into it, some have bought it.  They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them.  They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rivian.  The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars.  Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion.  They made several billion on that investment alone.</p></li>\n<li><p>One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control.  They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons.  As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical.  People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar.  This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Other side notes: Bronco will be massive and already doing well.  Yes, theyre less concerned with revenue so its dropping, but still, doubling profits but less revenue is fine.  New administration will likely invest heavily in Ford for EV&#39;s and even wrote a letter encouraging it to the prez.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lciq3s/why_you_should_buy_ford_stock_for_2021/","title":"Why you should buy Ford stock for 2021","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T19:01:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 19:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lciq3s","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lciq3s/why_you_should_buy_ford_stock_for_2021/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lciq3s/why_you_should_buy_ford_stock_for_2021/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"bludydawn","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bludydawn","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bludydawn","score":221,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么你应该在2021年买入福特股票？","the_new_excerpt":"今年早些时候，在8.50左右做了一个类似的DD，其只有越来越多的。\n随着今年的发展，看好。\n\n本来，主要有以下几个方面的启示。\n\n 1. 新CEO是表。汽车行业他的一生。他在做有意义的\n    改为福特，并能证明他能遵守承诺。这可以...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼你應該在2021年買入福特股票？","the_new_excerpt":"今年早些時候，在8.50左右做了一個類似的DD，其只有越來越多的。\n隨着今年的發展，看好。\n\n本來，主要有以下幾個方面的啓示。\n\n 1. 新CEO是表。汽車行業他的一生。他在做有意義的\n    改爲福特，並能證明他能遵守承諾。這可以...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1361799963475345415","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1361799963475345415","title":"The surge in US inflation expectations continues unabated, highest levels in over 8 years... https://t.co/Wl1EWdbTWT","date":"February 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国通胀预期的激增有增无减，为8年多来的最高水平，https://t.co/Wl1EWdbTWT。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國通脹預期的激增有增無減，爲8年多來的最高水平，https://t.co/Wl1EWdbTWT。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-llfznm","excerpt":"Surprise, surprise, it wasn’t Tesla or PayPal.
