But unlike typical bubble examples, TSLA&#39;s price has never really burst like a lot of people expected, and continues to look strong. I&#39;m curious, are there other stocks that were historically similar to this (ie., orders of magnitude overvalued for years), and did they ultimately grow into their valuation over time, or did they eventually see a bubble burst?
