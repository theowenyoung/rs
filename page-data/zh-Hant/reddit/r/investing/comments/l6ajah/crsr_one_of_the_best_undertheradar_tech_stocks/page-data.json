IMO Corsair is probably one of the most overlooked tech stocks on the market right now.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s up over <strong>165%</strong> since IPO last year, risen <strong>20%</strong> today, but I think theres still a LONG way to go.</p>\n\n<p>- <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/CRSR:NASDAQ\">CRSR</a> is a relatively new IPO, but a time-tested tech company in the explosive gaming industry, which has been among the best performing sectors throughout 2020. Thus far its been overlooked for bigger players like LOGITECH.</p>\n\n<p>- Their Q4 earnings reports are about to release on 2/9. They&#39;ll contain holiday season sales. Every related company in that space has been posting record Q4 sales.</p>\n\n<p>- IN 2019 they crossed $1bln revenue for the first time. If current revenue trends continue, its going to be approaching $2bln revenue for 2020. By several metrics they&#39;re growing FASTER than LOGI, at less than half the price.</p>\n\n<p>- Their market cap is currently  <strong>$4.17 Billion ....</strong>  Compare that to LOGI at <strong>$18 Billion.</strong> Despite TTM revenues approaching 50% of LOGI, the market cap is more than 4x lower. If you think LOGI is fairly priced (or under valued), then CRSR has a lot of room to go up.</p>\n\n<p>- They have recently been making some big acquisitions throughout 2019 and 2020, notably in the rapidly expanding streaming space where they&#39;re building market dominance (Snapping up Elgato was a big one).</p>\n\n<p>- Less diluted than LOGI (Looking at RPS, only 38% lower)</p>\n\n<p>- It blew past EPS estimates in Q2 and Q3. After Q3 earnings report share price doubled in 2 weeks. I think Q4 EPS estimates are very low. I see it absolutely crushing them.</p>\n\n<p>- Net Profit Margins have been increasing every quarter in 2020.  All other fundamentals are on a positive trajectory.... net debt going down, gross margins going up.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the rest of the market, if Q4 revenue are in line with expectations I think share price could easily hit $100 or more by Q2.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l6ajah/crsr_one_of_the_best_undertheradar_tech_stocks/","title":"CRSR - one of the best under-the-radar tech stocks with room to run.
