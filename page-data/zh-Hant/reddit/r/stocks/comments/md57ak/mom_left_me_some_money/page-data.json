I suffer from anxiety and have been keeping it in my savings. I knew I should invest it, but the fear of losing my mom&#39;s gift to me was debilitating. Now I&#39;m on wellbutrin and it&#39;s helped me alot. </p>\n\n<p>Yesterday I woke up and opened a brokerage account and shoved 500$ into AMD, INTEL, FORD, and some of that game store stock. (Hehehe)</p>\n\n<p>After breakfast I took 60k and parked it in a high interest savings account for now. .55%</p>\n\n<p>During lunch I took 10k and put in into a 10 year fidelity GO 60/40 account. (I have mixed feelings about bonds but it&#39;s better than letting it sit in savings.)</p>\n\n<p>Not sure what to do now. I&#39;d like to keep at least 20k available in case I decided to buy a house. But beyond that I&#39;m just not sure. Still worried there is a bubble In the economy and scared shitless I&#39;m going to lose this gift.</p>\n\n<p>Edit- about game stocks, I only have half a week&#39;s net wages in it. Nothing crazy.</p>\n\n<p>I really appreciate All the advice. I&#39;m going to be busy looking up dividends, indexes, fiduciaries and reference your comments in the future.</p>\n\n<p>As for that guy at the bottom, who said I&#39;m bragging...
