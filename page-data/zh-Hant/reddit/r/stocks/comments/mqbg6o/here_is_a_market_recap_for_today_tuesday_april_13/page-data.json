Market participants are closely monitoring the pace of vaccine distribution after US federal health officials called for the pause in the rollout of the Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine and the upcoming earnings season.</p>\n\n<p>In a joint statement posted to Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1381925612743499778\">(check out the thread here</a>), The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called for a pause in the rollout of the JNJ vaccine following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause &quot;out of an abundance of caution,&quot; the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.</p>\n\n<p>In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&amp;J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.”</p>\n\n<p>As earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter <a href=\"https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1\">earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%</a> over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Earnings season is kicking off Wednesday pre-market, with many big banks reporting earnings.</li>\n<li>Coinbase is set to go public tomorrow.
