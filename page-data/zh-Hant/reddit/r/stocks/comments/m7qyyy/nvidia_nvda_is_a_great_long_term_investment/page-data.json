Several ARM customers have raised concerns about Nvidia likely misusing/abusing its position as the default licensor, forcing customers to use  its own chips.</p>\n\n<p>With these concerns there will be heightened governmental and regulatory scrutiny into NVDA.</p>\n\n<p>There are two interesting articles on the ARM deal. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/03/11/why-the-nvidia-arm-acquisition-should-be-approved/?sh=44c39eac45b2\">Here’s the one from Forbes</a>–  the author is hopeful that the deal goes through and why. She believes that governments like the US will push through to gain and maintain its competitive advantage in A.I.</p>\n\n<p>The second is from Trading Places Research and called Nvidia and ARM: All About Control. It’s from Seeking Alpha and why the ARM acquisition makes sense for NVIDIA. Here’s the gist in the author’s own words.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“But in the end, NVIDIA is trying to do what Apple does regularly, and is so very successful with: control the core technologies behind its products. NVIDIA wants to build a data center behemoth built around the CPU-GPU-DPU-AI stack. They control three of the four layers, and the Arm acquisition would give them the fourth, and most important layer in the stack. They can build this Goliath licensing Arm technology, but they would be dependent on someone else’s roadmap. That someone else is mostly in the business of selling smartphone SoC IP, and is most interested in the future of IoT.  </p>\n\n<p>But again, this is precisely what is going to scare Arm’s customers so much. The entire smartphone ecosystem is dependent on the continued development of those cores, and if the company is shifting its attention to the data center, the rest may languish down the road. Those customers may even start looking at RISC-V. They have at least 18 months to mull it over, which is a lifetime in tech.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Valuation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sure, the stock&#39;s expensive at 530, but 3 years out NVDA earns about $24 a share, getting the PE down to 22, which is not bad for a 20% grower. </p>\n\n<p>Sources: Wall Street Journal, Seeking Alpha, Forbes, Motley Fool.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7qyyy/nvidia_nvda_is_a_great_long_term_investment/","title":"NVIDIA - $NVDA is a great long term investment","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T17:18:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 17:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m7qyyy","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7qyyy/nvidia_nvda_is_a_great_long_term_investment/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7qyyy/nvidia_nvda_is_a_great_long_term_investment/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Fountainheadusa","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fountainheadusa","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Fountainheadusa","score":97,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"英伟达--$NVDA是一项伟大的长期投资。","the_new_excerpt":"我今天买入了NVDA，追加了我在2018年启动的仓位，并已\n在大多数跌幅上不断加。\n\n牛市案例\n\n * 由于未来对GPU的需求将持续高涨，因此是一项很好的长期投资。\n   下一个十年\n * 数据中心、游戏和汽车等用户市场持续增长。\n *领导在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"英偉達--$NVDA是一項偉大的長期投資。","the_new_excerpt":"我今天買入了NVDA，追加了我在2018年啓動的倉位，並已\n在大多數跌幅上不斷加。\n\n牛市案例\n\n * 由於未來對GPU的需求將持續高漲，因此是一項很好的長期投資。\n   下一個十年\n * 數據中心、遊戲和汽車等用戶市場持續增長。\n *領導在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mn6sbu","excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-prosus-tencent-stake-idUSKBN2BU16P\n\nHolland-based technology investor Prosus NV has sold 2% of Tencent Holdings Ltd\n(0700.HK) for $14.7 billion, the Chinese gaming and social media giant said on\nThursday, in the world's largest-ever block trade.\n\nThe price was a…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mn6sbu/in_largest_block_trade_prosus_sells_2_of_tencent/","title":"In largest block trade, Prosus sells 2% of Tencent","date":"April 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"最大のブロック取引で、Prosus社がTencent社の2%を売却","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-prosus-tencent-stake-idUSKBN2BU16P\n\nオランダを拠点とするテクノロジー投資家Prosus NVは、Tencent Holdings Ltd.
