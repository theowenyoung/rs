This is part of growing and learning as an investor.</p>\n\n<p>But the thing that many people forget is the <strong>almost</strong> trades. Those trades that we got close to pulling the trigger on, but didn&#39;t. Whatever that reason was, we all have moves that we almost made but <em>something</em> made us pass on it. </p>\n\n<h1>Write them down.</h1>\n\n<p>Record every trade that you almost made, or considered making. Record the date, the current value, and the reason you didn&#39;t make the trade.</p>\n\n<p>This has been very valuable to me in my first few weeks of trading. We all look through our portfolio and our trade history and think, &quot;man - if only I held this longer&quot; or &quot;I really messed up buying this on the rise&quot;. But what we often forget is to give ourselves credit the the decisions we made that there isn&#39;t a history of on our chosen broker. For every single regret we have as traders, there is a dodged bullet that our gut, training, or education helped us avoid. On the flip side, there are also those securities we saw a post about, or noticed while browsing that sparked something in us but we hesitated on. Those ones that have been nothing but green since then and we are regretting.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t record the moves you <strong>almost</strong> made, then you&#39;re missing out on valuable person growth information that can help you become a better trader. Write down every move you almost made in a notebook and look back every once in a while. The more you write at the time the better.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this can help others as much as it&#39;s helped me. Good luck y&#39;all!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lhd8gm/a_tip_that_i_heard_right_when_i_started_trading/","title":"A tip that I heard right when I started trading that has helped keep me sane and grow as an investor","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T06:31:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 06:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lhd8gm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhd8gm/a_tip_that_i_heard_right_when_i_started_trading/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhd8gm/a_tip_that_i_heard_right_when_i_started_trading/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"SulkyVirus","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SulkyVirus","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"SulkyVirus","score":7258,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"在我刚开始交易时听到的一个小窍门，它帮助我保持了理性，并使我作为一个投资者不断成长。","the_new_excerpt":"我用真金白银做交易才一个月，但我读到了一些...\n几个月前，在做研究的时候，这真的是坚持，我想\n的份额。\n\n作为投资者，我们经常会看自己所做的动作，判断自己的\n我们错过的或我们击中的。这是成长的一部分...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在我剛開始交易時聽到的一個小竅門，它幫助我保持了理性，並使我作爲一個投資者不斷成長。","the_new_excerpt":"我用真金白銀做交易才一個月，但我讀到了一些...\n幾個月前，在做研究的時候，這真的是堅持，我想\n的份額。\n\n作爲投資者，我們經常會看自己所做的動作，判斷自己的\n我們錯過的或我們擊中的。這是成長的一部分...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ls7qf3","excerpt":"Please keep all the comments and opinions about current GME, AMC, etc. here.\nThanks.","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ls7qf3/overflow_sticky_thread_for_gme_etc/","title":"Overflow sticky thread for GME, etc.","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为GME等溢出粘性线。","the_new_excerpt":"关于目前GME、AMC等的意见和看法，请保留在这里。\n谢谢。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲GME等溢出粘性線。","the_new_excerpt":"關於目前GME、AMC等的意見和看法，請保留在這裏。\n謝謝。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lrjfzx","excerpt":"I own stock in these major players so maybe I’m partly biased, but I genuinely\nthink this area has been beaten down too much and has a lot of upside no one\nseems to really talk about.\n\nThe companies/stocks i’m getting at are the tobacco giants.
