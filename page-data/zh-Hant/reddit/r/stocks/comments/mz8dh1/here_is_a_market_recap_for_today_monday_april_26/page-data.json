Looking ahead, market participants are preparing for a slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and the Federal Open Market Committee’s April meeting.</p>\n\n<p>This week, a slew of huge companies are set to report corporate earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Altogether, the market caps of the companies reporting this week comprise nearly half the total market cap of the S&amp;P 500, according to FactSet. So far, the vast majority of companies have vastly exceeded analyst estimates, with effective vaccine distribution in the US helping stoke demand as the economy gradually reopens. </p>\n\n<p>Eighty-four percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results to date posted a positive earnings per share surprise, according to data from FactSet. This would mark the highest percentage of companies reporting upside surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, assuming this beat rate holds through the end of earnings season. </p>\n\n<p>Last week on Thursday, stocks sold off sharply following reports President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%. However, the sharp bounce back we have seen suggests the initial sell-off was overdone. Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we&#39;ll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I&#39;m sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet for its April meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a monetary policy decision and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell slated for Wednesday afternoon. With the Fed having already signaled that benchmark interest rates would remain on hold through at least 2023, market participants are expecting virtually no major changes to policy to be announced.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tesla (TSLA) beat analyst expectations in their earnings report. The stock is modestly down at the time of writing\n\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue of $10.39 billion vs $10.29 billion expected (up from $6 billion a year earlier)</li>\n<li>EPS of $0.93 vs $0.79 expected</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>The vaccinations effort continues with over 200 million Americans receiving at least one shot and 90 million adults fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by the CDC.</li>\n<li>The Biden administration wants to spend $174 billion to boost electric vehicles and charging stations but its 2030 climate emissions reduction pledge released on Thursday does not include a firm date to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. &quot;These autos are coming. We know it. It is the future,&quot; White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy said of EVs at an event in Washington promoting administration efforts to boost EV charging.</li>\n<li>In the wake of the fatal crash of a Tesla car in Texas on Saturday, two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla vehicles. </li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $157 to $158 at Overweight.
