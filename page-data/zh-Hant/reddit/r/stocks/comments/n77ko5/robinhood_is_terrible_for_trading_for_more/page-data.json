I was so mad about how much money I lost I sold every position I had and cashed out my account. About 5 minutes later when I cooled down I realized how stupid that was. There was no way I was going to give up trading but I triggered a PDT restriction with Robinhood so I deposited my funds into TD Ameritrade. Although, since leaving Robinhood I have noticed some positive changes in my portfolio. </p>\n\n<p>1) I don’t panic sell anymore. </p>\n\n<p>When you have Robinhood, they shove the charts in your face. Every move is very dramatic. A stock might only move a few cents but their charts make it look like the stock is up or down 30%. Since switching to TD I am able to let everything just sit without getting panicked. I think most money lost in the stock market is due to panic selling so if you can, don’t sell. Stocks pretty much always go up (with time) </p>\n\n<p>2) I don’t trade options anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Robinhood made it so easy to trade options. While I know people can make fortunes off options, more people lose their savings with them. I know I would get skinned alive for saying this at WSB but options are the devils lottery tickets. While I might not have huge swings, trading shares allows to have consistent gains. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, this is just what has worked for me. Who knows, maybe I have just been lucky these last couple weeks. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk, see you all behind Wendy’s.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/n77ko5/robinhood_is_terrible_for_trading_for_more/","title":"Robinhood is terrible for trading for more reasons then you think","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"May 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-07T21:09:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-07 21:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n77ko5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n77ko5/robinhood_is_terrible_for_trading_for_more/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n77ko5/robinhood_is_terrible_for_trading_for_more/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"GardinerAndrew","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GardinerAndrew","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"GardinerAndrew","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ロビンフッドがトレーディングに適していない理由は、あなたが思っている以上にたくさんあります。","the_new_excerpt":"私もCOIN IPOをプレイした一人です。あまりの損失の大きさに頭にきて\n損失の大きさに頭にきて、持っていたポジションをすべて売って、口座を現金化しました。約5分後\n5分後、冷静になってみると、それがいかに愚かなことだったかがわかりました。私には\n取引をあきらめるつもりはなかったのですが、PDT制限を発動してしまいました...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Robinhood在交易方面是很糟糕的，原因比你想象的要多。","the_new_excerpt":"我是玩COIN IPO的人之一。我很生气，因为我输了很多钱\n我很生气，因为我输了很多钱，我卖掉了我的每一个头寸，并把我的账户兑现了。大约5\n分钟后，当我冷静下来时，我意识到这是多么愚蠢。我不可能\n我不可能放弃交易，但我触发了PDT限制......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Robinhood在交易方面是很糟糕的，原因比你想象的要多。","the_new_excerpt":"我是玩COIN IPO的人之一。我很生氣，因爲我輸了很多錢\n我很生氣，因爲我輸了很多錢，我賣掉了我的每一個頭寸，並把我的賬戶兌現了。大約5\n分鐘後，當我冷靜下來時，我意識到這是多麼愚蠢。我不可能\n我不可能放棄交易，但我觸發了PDT限制......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1390756089646526464","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1390756089646526464","title":"Pay me in lumber","date":"May 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"材木で支払う","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"用木材支付我","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"用木材支付我","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-n6zin9","excerpt":"> US Steel (X\n> [https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=X&source=story_quote_link]),\n> which crashed to a record low last March\n> [https://www.investopedia.com/us-steel-stock-hits-all-time-low-4799379] amid\n> bankruptcy fears, has skyrocketed 200% in just 12 months.
