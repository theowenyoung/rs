With that being said, I present you with the following:</p>\n\n<p>I’m a fan of really <strong>really</strong> deep value.  This will likely be a long post, but I think you’ll find value in it if you can follow along (see what I did there?).  </p>\n\n<p>I’ll put the TLDR right here at the top:  KT Corp ($KT) is so undervalued it’s almost embarrassing.   When I say undervalued, I don’t mean by a little bit… I mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value.  At the time of my writing this, KT is trading at $10.62.  <strong>A realistic price target, if the market were to properly value this company, is ~$30.00</strong>  I’ll go in depth as to why as we continue through this story, but the long and short of it is the Tangible Book Value of KT Corporation is $19.66/share.  What does that mean?  It means if KT declared bankruptcy tomorrow, was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt, the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $19.66/share.  This does not take into consideration intangible assets – which have real value (in the $BILLIONS), but are harder to assess.  Again, it’s trading at $10.62 as of this writing (a price/tangible book value of only 0.54).  Value investors typically look for stocks trading at &lt;3.0 price/TBV.  Deep value would be &lt;1.0.  KT is trading at 0.54, and a price/book ratio of 0.42!  </p>\n\n<p>Shares are cheap, options are cheap.  Do what you will – hell, sell it short if you want – but I like shares and calls.</p>\n\n<p><strong>KT CORPORATE PROFILE</strong></p>\n\n<p>KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom) is a South Korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885 – but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form – with business operations sprinkled throughout Asia, Africa, USA &amp; Poland.  KT is South Korea’s first telecom company and dominates Korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete:</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Line of Business</strong></th>\n<th align=\"right\"><strong>% of Korean Market Share</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Mobile Services</td>\n<td align=\"right\">31.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Fixed-line local telephone &amp; VoIP</td>\n<td align=\"right\">64.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Broadband Internet Access</td>\n<td align=\"right\">40.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Pay TV Services</td>\n<td align=\"right\">31.6%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>As a conglomerate, KT has their hands in a number of diversified pots.</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Products &amp; Services</strong></th>\n<th align=\"right\"><strong>% of Total Revenue</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Mobile Services (incl. 5G)</td>\n<td align=\"right\">27.3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Fixed-line (incl.

KT has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program.  For what it’s worth in this day and age, the short % of shares outstanding is a measly 0.09%.  No one is going short on this thing at its current price.  You’d literally have to be insane to short it – it’d be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>FINANCIAL METRICS &amp; PEER COMPARISONS</strong></p>\n\n<p>KT’s balance sheet is rock solid.  While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis, it is still growing and maybe more importantly, doing so profitably.  I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above, but this cannot be understated.  If you were to liquidate the company entirely, shareholders would receive $20-30 per share after the debt had been repaid.  I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT.  </p>\n\n<p>Compared to US-based telecom services index peers:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/iOmE5mI.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/iOmE5mI.jpeg</a></p>\n\n<p>Using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $26.33 - $109.88 (unrealistic top end):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/0hYg7Zy.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/0hYg7Zy.jpeg</a></p>\n\n<p>Compared to industry peers/comps:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/lT8uPvh.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/lT8uPvh.jpeg</a></p>\n\n<p>The following comparison is really the tale of the tape.  When we look at tangible book value, we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value.  This is obvious, given the share price should exceed the liquidation value.  But we see the opposite being true for KT.  Again, <strong>it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value.</strong>  You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares, liquidate the company, and double your money.  This is what I mean by real <strong>deep fucking value.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/vGaVp9b.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/vGaVp9b.jpeg</a></p>\n\n<p>Not that we put much weight in them around here, but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well, with median upside of 33%. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Buhxpqq.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/Buhxpqq.jpeg</a></p>\n\n<p>They just published their updated earnings presentation and have positive forecasts for growth as well:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://corp.kt.com/eng/attach/record/2020/KT%20ER%20PT%204Q20%20ENG_FIN.pdf\">https://corp.kt.com/eng/attach/record/2020/KT%20ER%20PT%204Q20%20ENG_FIN.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>I am long shares and 07/16/21 $15 calls.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lh33b2/kt_deep_deep_value/","title":"$KT - Deep, Deep Value","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T23:25:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 23:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lh33b2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lh33b2/kt_deep_deep_value/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lh33b2/kt_deep_deep_value/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"clubba","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/clubba","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"clubba","score":172,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$KT - 深度，深度价值","the_new_excerpt":"显然，我们现在都在说这个，但我不是理财顾问，而你呢？\n应该做自己的DD。说到这里，我给大家介绍一下。\n\n我是一个真正的粉丝 真的很深的价值。这很可能是一篇长文，但我\n如果你能跟上的话，想必你会发现它的价值（看...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$KT - 深度，深度價值","the_new_excerpt":"顯然，我們現在都在說這個，但我不是理財顧問，而你呢？\n應該做自己的DD。說到這裏，我給大家介紹一下。\n\n我是一個真正的粉絲 真的很深的價值。這很可能是一篇長文，但我\n如果你能跟上的話，想必你會發現它的價值（看...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lrs6wg","excerpt":"Let’s face it when this sub went mainstream all of you went full boomer mode and\ncried for the good old days, but now thanks to all the new retards the moon is\nback on the menu boys! 🚀\n\nThey’ve held their own, learned the way and went full retard.
