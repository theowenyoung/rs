I&#39;m SUPER LATE compared to when I usually post this, but below you&#39;ll find the watchlist notes for potential plays this week!</p>\n\n<p>I usually do a livestream every Sunday and do the charting so people can watch and learn, but I couldn&#39;t do it yesterday. However, I had the Discord members send me their tickers so that I could chart them when I had time. Below is my technical analysis with targets for what they sent me. If you want to see the charts along with the notes included, you can view them <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJv1GNXJzzn_kEoiZlRFGbL1e9GAFsrP?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Last week was rough for everyone (although I&#39;m sure everyone will agree that the Powell pump on Wed was AMAZING) so I hope this week is a lot better for you!</p>\n\n<p>-Davin</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<strong>Recap From Last Week’s Watchlist // Tickers = 6 // Targets Hit = 2 // Success Rate: 33%</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>$RIDE</strong>----No targets hit. Held the support we identified, but couldn’t fill the gap up to $18. Slowly bled off the rest of the week down to a low of $12.60</p>\n\n<p><strong>$AQB</strong>----first target hit on Monday. It was $0.01 away from reaching our second target. Been choppy all week, but still holding above support line that it was resting on the prior Friday during AH</p>\n\n<p><strong>$UBER</strong>----no targets hit. Highest it reached was $61.02 on Tuesday, but that was still $0.28 away from our first target. Fell all throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, stayed above 200 EMA on 4hr chart from Wednesday to Friday. Now back above 23.6% fib level so could be a potential play heading into this new week</p>\n\n<p><strong>$AM</strong>----no targets hit. Uptrend support didn’t hold and slowly trended down throughout the week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>$PLTR</strong>----no targets hit. First target was missed by $0.28 which was during premarket on Monday. PLTR took a doodoo throughout the rest of the week and hit a low of $23.39</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>*\\</strong>* - denotes the plays from the members that I really like and will be watching as well</p>\n\n<p><strong>$FUBO:</strong> seems to be holding support along the 61.8% fib level which is plotted as $29.55. If that holds and volume comes through we could see a gap fill up to $35.77. It’s holding support really well AND showing low volume the past two weeks, which is great to see if you’re wanting to go long because it shows strength even with decreased trading.</p>\n\n<p>PT if $29.55 holds: $33 (conservative) &gt; high $35’s</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>**$SPCE:</strong> Looking at the daily chart, I’m thinking it’ll fall down instead of head up, but we’ll have to see what happens during PM and Monday. If it can reclaim the downtrend resistance as support, then we can focus on the resistances as our targets. But, I’ll focus on the downside for now with how the chart is looking unless something shows me otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>PT: $30 (low of prior trading day candles) &gt; $28 (200 ema) &gt; $24 (0% fib level from drawing on downtrend)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>$TME:</strong> Has earnings coming up later this morning, which is likely why it had a small run the past three trading days. Looks to have made new highs, so it’s a bit risky getting in now. I personally hate trading things when it’s at new highs until it starts consolidating and making new levels, but that’s not to say there’s no money to be made. I drew a fib extension to see what we’re dealing with and it looks like it already made it to the 100% extension level and is holding it as support on the 4hr. Hard to make a prediction where this could go ahead of earnings as I haven’t done any DD on the company, but I’ll give targets shown with the support/resistance levels below.</p>\n\n<p>PT (upside): low $31’s &gt; high $32’s</p>\n\n<p>PT (downside): $30 &gt; $29 &gt; mid $28’s</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>**NFLX:</strong> Pretty much trading sideways the past two weeks. Hopefully that changes this week since the earnings report is coming up in about a month. Need to watch and wait to see if it breaks out of the consolidation it’s doing right now. More importantly, it needs to get above that $511 level and hold it as support to push up. If it fails that, we could see it drop towards the 200 EMA and uptrend support line, but I’m leaning more towards the upside due to earnings.</p>\n\n<p>PT (upside): $516 &gt; $530 &gt; $542</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>**$AMD:</strong> Great looking chart as far as a buying opportunity goes. It’s near the key support level ($73.71) of the consolidation channel it’s been in since July of last year. Price is sitting on top of the 200 EMA on the daily chart as support, but if that gives we could see it falling to the uptrend support/key support in consolidation channel at what point I’d definitely want to take a position either shares or options a few weeks to a few months away.</p>\n\n<p>PT (upside): high $81’s &gt; high $84’s &gt; $87 &gt; $89</p>\n\n<p>PT (downside): high $77’s &gt; high $75’s &gt; $74</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>**$RBLX:</strong> Bounced off the support at $67.17 and now trading real tight along the 200 EMA on the 4hr. Will need more trading time to see which way we’re heading because we’re also trading within a symmetrical triangle. Could break up towards resistance (which I’m leaning toward the most) or down towards support at which point I’d pay attention for a bounce.</p>\n\n<p>PT (upside): $72 &gt; $76</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>$AAPL:</strong> Will be paying attention to this as we have a current call option in play, but looks to be heading up from support (both the uptrend and downtrend) which is great!</p>\n\n<p>PT: mid $121’s &gt; mid $122’s &gt; $124 &gt; $125</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>$SBBP:</strong> Currently charting this as PM opened up and it took the hell off (LOL). If it holds this level at $4.63 we could see a gap fill to the high of PM of $5.46.</p>\n\n<p>PT (upside): $5.46 &gt; $6.33 &gt; $6.82 &gt; $7.00</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This information is for educational and entertainment purposes only.
