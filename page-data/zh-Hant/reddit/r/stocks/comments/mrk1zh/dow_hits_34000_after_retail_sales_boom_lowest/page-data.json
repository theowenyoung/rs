The latest number comes after 55 weeks of claims that have far surpassed the pre-pandemic average.  </p>\n\n<p>“With a huge, better-than-expected decline in new claims for unemployment assistance, at long last the economic recovery appears to be picking up speed,&quot; said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. However, nearly 17 million Americans still receiving some form of unemployment assistance, he added.  </p>\n\n<p>Retail sales, which had fallen by 3 percent in February, jumped to an increase of 9.8 percent for the month of March, after a fresh round of stimulus checks fueled consumer spending on clothes, sporting goods and cars.  </p>\n\n<p>That data, reported Thursday morning by the Commerce Department, roundly beat forecasts for a 6.1 percent gain and showed the best month since May last year, when the first tranche of economic impact payments boosted retail spending by more than 18 percent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mrk1zh/dow_hits_34000_after_retail_sales_boom_lowest/","title":"Dow hits 34,000 after retail sales boom, lowest weekly jobless claims since pandemic began","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-16T06:55:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-16 06:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mrk1zh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mrk1zh/dow_hits_34000_after_retail_sales_boom_lowest/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mrk1zh/dow_hits_34000_after_retail_sales_boom_lowest/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"diddycarter","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/diddycarter","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"diddycarter","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"小売売上高が好調でダウは34,000ドルに到達、週間失業保険申請件数はパンデミック後最低となる","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/dow-soars-new-record-high-after-retail-sales-boom-lowest-n1264174\n\n\n\n> ダウ平均株価が史上初めて34,000ドルの大台に乗りました。\n> 史上初となる34,000ドルの大台を突破したことを発表しました。\n> 肯定的な経済指標、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"道指在零售销售繁荣后触及34000点，每周申请失业救济人数为疫情开始以来最低。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/dow-soars-new-record-high-after-retail-sales-boom-lowest-n1264174\n\n\n\n> 道琼斯工业平均指数首次突破34000点大关。\n>历史上周四，华尔街在经历了一系列的暴涨之后，创下了历史新高。\n>积极的经济数据，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"道指在零售銷售繁榮後觸及34000點，每週申請失業救濟人數爲疫情開始以來最低。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/dow-soars-new-record-high-after-retail-sales-boom-lowest-n1264174\n\n\n\n> 道瓊斯工業平均指數首次突破34000點大關。\n>歷史上週四，華爾街在經歷了一系列的暴漲之後，創下了歷史新高。\n>積極的經濟數據，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mruyhb","excerpt":"Original Article:\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3682347-hsbc-reportedly-barring-customers-from-buying-shares-of-coinbase\n\nYou can't buy shares in COIN and MSTR.\n\n * HSBC (NYSE:HSBC\n  …","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mruyhb/hsbc_reportedly_barring_customers_from_buying/","title":"HSBC reportedly barring customers from buying shares of Coinbase","date":"April 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"HSBCが顧客にCoinbaseの株式購入を禁止していると報じられる","the_new_excerpt":"オリジナル記事\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3682347-hsbc-reportedly-barring-customers-from-buying-shares-of-coinbase\n\nCOINとMSTRの株は買えません。\n\n * hsbc (nyse:hsbc)\n  ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"据报道，汇丰银行禁止客户购买Coinbase的股票。","the_new_excerpt":"原创文章。\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3682347-hsbc-reportedly-barring-customers-from-buying-shares-of-coinbase\n\n你不能买COIN和MSTR的股票。\n\n * 汇丰银行（NYSE:HSBC）\n  …","locale":"zh"},{"title":"據報道，匯豐銀行禁止客戶購買Coinbase的股票。","the_new_excerpt":"原創文章。\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3682347-hsbc-reportedly-barring-customers-from-buying-shares-of-coinbase\n\n你不能買COIN和MSTR的股票。\n\n * 匯豐銀行（NYSE:HSBC）\n  …","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1382861367238090757","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1382861367238090757","title":"2000: we're coming for you... https://t.co/wwsmGCrM5k","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 16, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"2000: We're coming for you... https://t.co/wwsmGCrM5k","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"2000年：我们为你而来...... https://t.co/wwsmGCrM5k","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"2000年：我們爲你而來...... https://t.co/wwsmGCrM5k","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mrk1zh","previousId":"RedditPost-mruyhb","nextId":"TweetPost-1382861367238090757","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mrk1zh/dow_hits_34000_after_retail_sales_boom_lowest/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
