Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So you know what I did? I followed the instruction in the message that said &quot;please copy your post and repost without mentioning R*<em>**h</em>*d .&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So my next post didn&#39;t say R*<em>**h</em>*d on it in any way shape or form.</p>\n\n<p>It was also removed by the automoderator. </p>\n\n<p>I got this message: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sorry your post was removed in <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> because the title tells me you&#39;re new, so we&#39;re going to get you setup:</p>\n\n<p>See our wiki which has virtually everything on stock picking\nIf instead you just want the fast route to investing, see here.\nA list of brokers here.\nNeed to practice?\nBook recommendations\nWebsites that&#39;ll help you get better or get stock info.\nDid you need a trading system?

Fair enough. I wanted to <strong>share what I learned</strong> which was CLEARLY encouraged in the message from the automoderator.</p>\n\n<p>So I modified my post A THIRD TIME. This time, it didn&#39;t get automatically removed. It had a score of 21 and had received a wholesome award by the time it was removed. Along with my removal, I got a THREE DAY BAN and this message from the mod team:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You have been temporarily banned from participating in <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a>. This ban will last for 3 days. You can still view and subscribe to <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a>, but you won&#39;t be able to post or comment.</p>\n\n<p>Note from the moderators:</p>\n\n<p>Stop making new posts we have had 100+ lessons learned GME posts in the last few days. Use the Stickied threads or existing GME threads.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> by replying to this message.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At this point, I felt like I hadn&#39;t violated any rules, especially to an extent that deserved a ban. The reason they gave me for my ban is to &quot;stop making Ga me st op posts.&quot; Well... that&#39;s not in the rules, is it?</p>\n\n<p>So I reached out to the mod team and said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A ban without a warning is pretty uncool. More people seemed to like my post than dislike it.</p>\n\n<p>Probably won&#39;t be returning to this subreddit since I feel so unwelcomed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And they sent me this message:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Automoderator did warn you, twice. Generally we perma ban for this, but the other mod gave you a 3 day temp ban with only 2 more days to go, so you&#39;re over reacting.</p>\n\n<p>Next time read the automod messages that are sent you to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So that&#39;s my whole story here. Citizens of <a href=\"/r/stocks\">/r/stocks</a>, you tell me. Was my ban deserved? Or was the mod team out of line?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ljbprd/the_mods_of_this_subreddit_set_very_unclear/","title":"The mods of this subreddit set very unclear expectations and ban people without just cause.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T02:29:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 02:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ljbprd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ljbprd/the_mods_of_this_subreddit_set_very_unclear/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ljbprd/the_mods_of_this_subreddit_set_very_unclear/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"slightlystronger","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/slightlystronger","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"slightlystronger","score":869,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"这个分论坛的版主设定的期望值非常不明确，在没有正当理由的情况下禁言。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近在这个subreddit发了一个帖子。\n\n它被automoderator删除了。\n\n自动管理人给我发了以下信息。\n\n> 对不起，你的帖子在r/stocks[/r/stocks]被删除了，因为规则4：\n> R***hd应用应该在r/R**hd讨论。我们已经将讨论列入白名单\n> 关于...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這個分論壇的版主設定的期望值非常不明確，在沒有正當理由的情況下禁言。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近在這個subreddit發了一個帖子。\n\n它被automoderator刪除了。\n\n自動管理人給我發了以下信息。\n\n> 對不起，你的帖子在r/stocks[/r/stocks]被刪除了，因爲規則4：\n> R***hd應用應該在r/R**hd討論。我們已經將討論列入白名單\n> 關於...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-luga3j","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luga3j/is_it_monday_yet/","title":"Is it Monday Yet","date":"February 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"今天是星期一吗？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天是星期一嗎？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ltz2lb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltz2lb/i_didnt_eat_yesterday_so_i_could_make_this_melvin/","title":"I didn't eat yesterday so I could make this, \"Melvin Capital needs tough love\" gg APES GO BLASTOFF","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 28, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我昨天没吃饭，所以可以做这个，\"梅尔文资本需要强硬的爱 \"gg APES GO BLASTOFF。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我昨天沒喫飯，所以可以做這個，\"梅爾文資本需要強硬的愛 \"gg APES GO BLASTOFF。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ljbprd","previousId":"RedditPost-luga3j","nextId":"RedditPost-ltz2lb","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ljbprd/the_mods_of_this_subreddit_set_very_unclear/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
