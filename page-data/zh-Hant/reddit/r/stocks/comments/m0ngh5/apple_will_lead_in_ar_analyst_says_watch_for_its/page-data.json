Savitz•📷Last Updated March 8, 2021, 11:06 AM</p>\n\n<p>Over time, Apple has been a pioneer in the way humans work with computers. Although it isn&#39;t always at the head of the innovation curve, no company has had a more dramatic impact on the way humans and machines interact.</p>\n\n<p>As TFI Asset Management analyst Ming-Chi Kuo pointed out in a research note released over the weekend, Apple popularized the mouse and graphical user interface for computers, the iPod click wheel, and multi-touch functionality for the iPhone and iPad. And he says Apple can lead the way in the next leap in computing interfaces: mixed and augmented reality.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We believe that MR/AR will be the next critical technology to define the innovative human-machine interface for electronic products,&quot; Kuo wrote in the note. &quot;We believe that MR/AR will provide innovative visual experiences and redefine human behavior in creating, processing, and receiving information, which is why Apple is highly committed to MR/AR. One of Apple&#39;s advantages is defining the innovative human-machine interface, so we are taking a positive view of Apple&#39;s future in MR/AR.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Kuo argued that in the long run, MR/AR interfaces will replace all display-equipped electronic products. Apple&#39;s strategy will unfold in three stages, he predicted.</p>\n\n<p>He expects Apple to launch a helmet for virtual and augmented reality experiences by mid-2022. Kuo says the helmet will be equipped with Sony-built Micro-OLED displays and various optical modules to provide a &quot;video see-through AR experience,&quot; but with the ability to offer virtual-reality experiences as well.</p>\n\n<p>He thinks the price tag of the helmet will be similar to that of high-end iPhones, at about $1,000. Kuo expects the contract manufacturer Pegatron to produce the helmets.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Although Apple has been focusing on AR, we think the hardware specifications of this product can provide an immersive experience that is significantly better than existing VR products,&quot; he wrote. &quot;We believe that Apple may highly integrate this helmet with video-related applications (like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, etc.) as one of the key selling points.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Kuo said Apple&#39;s second product in this category will be MR/AR glasses. He doesn&#39;t think Apple has an existing prototype, and wrote that the glasses won&#39;t reach the market before 2025, at the earliest. Kuo thinks the glasses will be more specifically intended for augmented reality applications. &quot;We are looking forward to seeing the integration of glasses and Apple Car to provide an innovative user experience,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>Even farther out, in 2030 or later, he expects Apple to offer a contact-lens product with MR/AR capabilities. &quot;This product will bring electronics from the era of &quot;visible computing&quot; to &quot;invisible computing, &quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>Apple as a matter of policy doesn&#39;t discuss unannounced products, and hasn&#39;t addressed any of these potential devices. The stock was down 1.9%, to $119.18 on Monday morning.</p>\n\n<p>Write to Eric J.
