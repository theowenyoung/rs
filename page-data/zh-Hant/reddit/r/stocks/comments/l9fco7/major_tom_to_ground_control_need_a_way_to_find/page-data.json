Are you new to the stock-life and do not know your ass from your rocket emoji? </p>\n\n<p>Well, I think I have created a data driven system that will help you find the exploding stocks on Reddit. Every hour the chart will update and provide you with real analytics that illustrate the most talked about stocks on reddit. Each stock, according to popularity on the selected subreddit, is granted a “Reddit score.” This “Reddit Score” is then broken down to time periods of popularity, 12 hours and 12-24 hours. While also providing an indication on the number of “rockets,” or upvotes, that it has received. </p>\n\n<p>With this, you are afforded a starting point for DD and discussion, as well as the opportunity to comb through the raising star stocks.  </p>\n\n<p>There is NO login; NO subscription; NO commitment. Visit the site, see what is popular, and make your investing decisions more directed. A designed tool that is simply helping us, the common investor, reach the moon. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stock-rockets.com\">https://www.stock-rockets.com</a></p>\n\n<p>tl;dr: Website that shows you the trending stocks according to subreddit mentions and rockets. </p>\n\n<p>This website and post do not serve as financial advice of any sort.
