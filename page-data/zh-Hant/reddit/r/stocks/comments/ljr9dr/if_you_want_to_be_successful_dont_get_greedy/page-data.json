I recommended a strong stock I’ve done good DD on but cautioned it will take awhile to see any gains.</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks later it increased 20% on some good news and then dropped 5% for net 15%.  He’s texting me days later “wtf poison_ivey this stock blows, when is it going to take off??”</p>\n\n<p>With all the recent hype some people are looking for X00% overnight and expect massive gains with no effort.  It’s also really hard to sell when something you own is on a crazy run and FOMO creeps in.</p>\n\n<p>The key success here is don’t get greedy.   Take your profits and protect your capital core.  Every stock is different and nothing is ever a sure bet.  Lululemon used to be a really strong buy but took a huge dip a few years back because of allegations against the founder</p>\n\n<p>My average annual return is 20%.  It’s not as sexy as making infinite gains on shorts but it means I will retire a lot sooner than I thought I ever could.  If one of my tickers hits bigger than I thought I reassess value and often I take my book value and use the gravy to ride that train the rest of the way</p>\n\n<p>If you could afford to invest $1k per year you could retire w over a million, and way more if you can increase your annual investment more each year.</p>\n\n<p>Compound interest at a rate of return of 20% after\n20 years = $275k ($20k invested @ $1k per year.\n25 years = $775k ($25k invested @$1k per year).\n30 years = $1.3M ($30k invested @$1k per year).</p>\n\n<p>After 30 years you could retire and earn an annual income of $78k with a passive 6% interest without eroding that core $1.3M.</p>\n\n<p>Start small and be patient.  Decide what percentage of your capital you are willing to go YOLO on and what amount you need to protect to avoid that “holy crap what have I done I’ve lost everything and I’m going to vomit” feeling.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ljr9dr/if_you_want_to_be_successful_dont_get_greedy/","title":"If you want to be successful don’t get greedy.
