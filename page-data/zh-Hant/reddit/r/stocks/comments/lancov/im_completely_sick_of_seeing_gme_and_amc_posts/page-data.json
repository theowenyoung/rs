So I really hope to start seeing some DD posts about new companies or existing ones with potentially bright futures. </p>\n\n<p>I was in amc at 2.41 a week before they took off fully having researched and believing theatres will make a comeback and that that share price was an absolute steal. I was rewarded for this but only by luck, not by AMC themselves. Luckily I’m able to distinguish that and not consider this pure luck as me being some expert investor in my first week of investing</p>\n\n<p>Right now I’m in sundial. It’s a penny, high risk high reward stock. The ceo is making headway toward profitability and that’s really all we can ask for, a ceo who is willing to do whatever it takes to succeed= good odds of success in my eyes. All anyone can do is try, sundial is up today in a good way. Hoping to see more good results tomorrow</p>\n\n<p>Just saying though, like the people constantly bombarding with GME posts are seeing a lot of fucking new income, getting high off it and are now just as fucking greedy as wallstreet folks.. like lol. It was never about taking on the big guys. If it was, it was only like the first few days of it now it’s just greedy.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lancov/im_completely_sick_of_seeing_gme_and_amc_posts/","title":"I’m completely sick of seeing GME and AMC posts","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T07:02:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 07:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lancov","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lancov/im_completely_sick_of_seeing_gme_and_amc_posts/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lancov/im_completely_sick_of_seeing_gme_and_amc_posts/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TheTargaryen28","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTargaryen28","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"TheTargaryen28","score":604,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我完全厌倦了看到GME和AMC的帖子","the_new_excerpt":"我对市场上的其他股票基本上都比较感兴趣，在\n这一点。所以我真的希望开始看到一些关于新公司的DD帖子\n或现有的与潜在的光明的未来。\n\n我在AMC在2.41一个星期前，他们完全起飞研究和\n相信...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我完全厭倦了看到GME和AMC的帖子","the_new_excerpt":"我對市場上的其他股票基本上都比較感興趣，在\n這一點。所以我真的希望開始看到一些關於新公司的DD帖子\n或現有的與潛在的光明的未來。\n\n我在AMC在2.41一個星期前，他們完全起飛研究和\n相信...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-likb1g","excerpt":"TLDR: Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by\nDTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it\nwould've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened.
