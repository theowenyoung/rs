Some people listened, processed information and asked questions. Some called me a person working for Melvin and hedge funds.</p>\n\n<p>It’s all in the past, but if you got burned on GME or other meme stocks, here are few things you should learn about the markets and trading these bubbles.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Set a price at which you will exit and take profit. Don’t look at what happens next, and never rebuy  if the price continues growing. Likewise, set a stop loss at which you will exit no matter what. </p></li>\n<li><p>Never, and I mean never put in more than you can afford to lose, or even lose sleep over. I have a pretty decent portfolio, and I only put in 0.5% of it in the play. I don’t give a shit about that money, but I still took profit and got a 250% ROI. Easiest cash I’ve ever made, easier than blowing a fat dude in the back alley behind a strip bar.\nAnyway.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you hear about shit on the news. It’s probably not a good time to enter. There is a reason why some early people made money on the play. They understood mechanics of what was driving the increase in price. Many of them didn’t even expect a short squeeze, they just like the fundamentals. Likewise, if your 80 year old grannie (say hi to her from me) calls you and asks you about this magical company called GameStonk, sell that shit right away. </p></li>\n<li><p>Always double and triple check information posted on forums and don’t take it for a truth even if it has a lot of upvotes. The amount of misinformation I saw on WSB over the past week with 100 thousand upvotes makes me want to vomit.</p></li>\n<li><p>Stock trading is not a team activity. It’s not us vs them. It’s a fucking free for all, and people will drop their bags on you if they see their unrealized gain turn into an unrealized loss. You want to make money? Do your research, and be the first one on the train. Don’t jump on the train when it is speeding and going off the rails.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you don’t understand how something works, learn about it. Again, the amount of conspiracy theories that I read about ladder attacks and this grand illuminati conspiracy is driving me nuts. Always use the Occam’s razor, meaning if there is a simple explanation to the situation, it is probably right. There is no need to build out this conspiracy theory for something you don’t understand, it does not help anyone.</p></li>\n<li><p>You will get FOMO and you will get confirmation bias. Everybody does, but learning how to battle it is crucial. Look, my dad was a fucking casino gambler in his 30s playing blackjack and losing money, and I have the same traits. Does it mean I need to be the same? No, and I always remember my genes when trading. It is not an excuse to use when you lose money.</p></li>\n<li><p>Realize that situations like this are extremely rare, and if you expect to make 300% gain in 3 days, I have some bad fucking news for you, markets don’t work like this.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finance gets complicated real fast. Yes, on the surface it’s just buying and selling. I have been studying this shit for 5 years, and I still don’t know a lot of things. There are reasons why even some of the smartest people still lose money. Shit, Newton was burned on a South Sea bubble. Yes, that guy who discovered gravity lost money just any of us. </p></li>\n<li><p>One bad trade does not define you. As long as you learn, and don’t repeat the same shit again, you are golden. There are plenty of ways to make money on the markets, be it value investing, selling options or setting up butterfly spreads. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Be smart, not dumb.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lb65qf/what_you_should_learn_from_the_meme_mania/","title":"What you should learn from the meme mania","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T23:33:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 23:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lb65qf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lb65qf/what_you_should_learn_from_the_meme_mania/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lb65qf/what_you_should_learn_from_the_meme_mania/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"MichKOG","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MichKOG","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"MichKOG","score":1038,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你应该从追忆狂中学习什么？","the_new_excerpt":"怎么样了，我的朋友们\n\n我做了这篇关于投资的文章\n[https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l8yi83/common_misconceptions_about_markets/]\n几天前解释了QAnon的所有幻想，以及为什么上面可以。\n已经是过去式了。有些人听了，处理信息，并...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你應該從追憶狂中學習什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"怎麼樣了，我的朋友們\n\n我做了這篇關於投資的文章\n[https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l8yi83/common_misconceptions_about_markets/]\n幾天前解釋了QAnon的所有幻想，以及爲什麼上面可以。\n已經是過去式了。有些人聽了，處理信息，並...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lizq65","excerpt":"Hi folks!
