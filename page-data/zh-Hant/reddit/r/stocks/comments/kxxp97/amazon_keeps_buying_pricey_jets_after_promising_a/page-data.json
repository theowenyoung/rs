The ultimate aim is to ensure that virtually every product the company sells is a van ride—and eventually a drone flight—away from customers’ homes. And yet, last week Amazon announced it was buying 11 Boeing 767-300 jets for its air-cargo division, mostly to get products to Prime subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>The expanded air-cargo operation will add billions of dollars to already hefty shipping costs that amounted to $52 billion in the 12 months ended in September. Though Amazon is one of the wealthiest and most valuable companies in the world, it has historically operated on razor-thin margins and plowed cash back into the business, sometimes to the consternation of investors who’d rather see the company focus on profitability.</p>\n\n<p>Even as Amazon expands its air-cargo division, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos remains fixated on his ultimate dream: building a network so sophisticated it can get just about anything to a customer’s doorstep in 30 minutes or less. One day his vision will bring another air carrier to life, the Prime Now drone fleet, that along with autonomous vehicles and electric vans could make it less necessary to fly stuffed giraffes across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the award.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxxp97/amazon_keeps_buying_pricey_jets_after_promising_a/","title":"Amazon Keeps Buying Pricey Jets After Promising a Drone Fleet","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T00:04:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 00:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kxxp97","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxxp97/amazon_keeps_buying_pricey_jets_after_promising_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxxp97/amazon_keeps_buying_pricey_jets_after_promising_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"coolcomfort123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/coolcomfort123","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"coolcomfort123","score":66,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"亚马逊在承诺建立无人机舰队后，继续购买昂贵的喷气式飞机。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/amazon-prime-overnight-shipping-guarantees-rely-on-fleet-of-pricey-jets?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google\n\n亚马逊公司在美国开设仓库和航运中心的速度。\n大约每24小时一个。最终目的是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"亞馬遜在承諾建立無人機艦隊後，繼續購買昂貴的噴氣式飛機。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/amazon-prime-overnight-shipping-guarantees-rely-on-fleet-of-pricey-jets?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google\n\n亞馬遜公司在美國開設倉庫和航運中心的速度。\n大約每24小時一個。最終目的是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l7datt","excerpt":"With all the hullabaloo about GME and other meme stocks, this kinda flew under\nthe radar.
