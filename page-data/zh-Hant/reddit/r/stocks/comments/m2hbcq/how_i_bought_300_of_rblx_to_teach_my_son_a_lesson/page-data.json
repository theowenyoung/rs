My 8 year old son discovered this while playing Roblox and went on a Robux buying spree to the tune of $427. We only caught it because of the confirmation emails a few days later. We were only able to reclaim $115 from Google.  He lost the device, and his favorite game, for a long time. </p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today. I have been giving my son $5 a week for chores into a custodian trading account.  I luckily I picked a few good stocks and he has a nice little ~$300 Disney Trip fund for toys, swag, etc. I told him I was going to spend his savings on buying RBLX. I explained to him about market cap, shares outstanding, float and he understood 0 of these things... But I also explained that putting $300 into a game vs $300 into a game company were different things and (inner monologue: while probably over priced at the moment) it may grow his Disney Trip fund while he supports the company that has brought him so much pandemic joy. He was totally jazzed about this prospect and investing in general. Also... payback... sort of.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m2hbcq/how_i_bought_300_of_rblx_to_teach_my_son_a_lesson/","title":"How I bought $300 of RBLX to teach my son a lesson on investing","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-11T07:09:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-11 07:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m2hbcq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2hbcq/how_i_bought_300_of_rblx_to_teach_my_son_a_lesson/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m2hbcq/how_i_bought_300_of_rblx_to_teach_my_son_a_lesson/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"csharp","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/csharp","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"csharp","score":4030,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我是如何买了300元的RBLX给儿子上投资课的？","the_new_excerpt":"几个月前，由于我仍然无法解释的原因，家长控制上的。\n在安卓设备上购物时，停止要求输入密码。我8岁的儿子\n在玩Roblox的时候发现了这一点，于是疯狂的购买Robux，以\n427美元的调子。我们只是抓住了它，因为确认... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我是如何買了300元的RBLX給兒子上投資課的？","the_new_excerpt":"幾個月前，由於我仍然無法解釋的原因，家長控制上的。\n在安卓設備上購物時，停止要求輸入密碼。我8歲的兒子\n在玩Roblox的時候發現了這一點，於是瘋狂的購買Robux，以\n427美元的調子。我們只是抓住了它，因爲確認... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-memh0k","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/memh0k/ouch/","title":"OUCH","date":"March 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"OUCH","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"OUCH","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-meugbc","excerpt":"Alright, I’m going to try to explain what I think is going to happen after SLR\ncomes into effect.
