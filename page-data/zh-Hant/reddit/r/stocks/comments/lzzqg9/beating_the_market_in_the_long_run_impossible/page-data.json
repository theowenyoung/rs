I believe that there are many simple reasons why most don’t. </p>\n\n<p>The first reason I think is that people are greedy and once they see a stock move up 100% in 6 months, they get fomo and hop on when really they should not have done so. Then they realize the hype has died and we see a correction where now they are down 15% from ATH, which brings me to my next point.</p>\n\n<p>The second reason is they PANIC. They see their investment loses 15% in a week and they realize they made a mistake. So they sell at a lost and move it to cash. Which brings me to my next point.</p>\n\n<p>Third reason I believe is that they don’t have PATIENCE! If you are convicted that a stock is a strong company, then you have to ride it out and be patient. Strong companies usually will pull through unless they are in a fraudulent situation.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest reasons, imo, are that people can just get greedy and get fomo then lose patience when their greed loses them money. </p>\n\n<p>Thoughts wanted.
