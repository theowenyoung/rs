They are now multi-faceted. You can consider them a <strong>technology</strong> stock with high growth (i.e  DIS+,  HULU), <strong>entertainment</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>news</strong> stock (i.e ESPN, Marvel, Star Wars, Disney being the obvious), or even a <strong>reopening</strong> play (i.e their amusement parks, cruiselines, shopping districts).</p>\n\n<p>Their latest earnings report was excellent, but was overshadowed by the nasty drop in tech stocks the last month. Even then, DIS hardly dropped and is reclaiming the 200$ price point.</p>\n\n<p>UBS has a price target of 200$ with the average price targets totaling to 205 according to FinViz.</p>\n\n<p>Catalyst --&gt; DIS to reopen parks in California by April 30. This is huge. The company is only operating from half strength right now in it&#39;s online presence of DISNEY+ and other foreign theme parks. I&#39;m from Orange County where the parks are located and there is a strong community of people who will rush to go to the park. Competitor amusement parks such as Knott&#39;s berry farm in the area already started hiring thousands of employees in preparation for reopening and Disney will do the same.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile DIS has a strong prospect for its streaming purposes. Total subscribers across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ were over 140 million in January. Management has forecasted it doubling to 300M+ by 2024. For reference, Netflix has around 200million right now in the 4th quarter of 2020. Prior to DISNEY+, the company has not had a direct connection to its consumers besides the parks, but now it has &quot;hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide being fed a constant stream of content throughout the year.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I believe Disney will retest the 200 position and have more to grow from there depending if market conditions have calmed. This is easily a large growth stock going into 2021.</p>\n\n<p>My current positions:  DIS 4/16 200C&#39;s</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7kybq/the_walt_disney_company_a_multisector_play_dis/","title":"The Walt Disney Company, a multi-sector play $DIS","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T15:58:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 15:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m7kybq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7kybq/the_walt_disney_company_a_multisector_play_dis/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7kybq/the_walt_disney_company_a_multisector_play_dis/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"itskayyuhvin","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/itskayyuhvin","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"itskayyuhvin","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"华特-迪士尼公司，多板块玩法$DIS。","the_new_excerpt":"小编给大家写一篇迪士尼的波段好戏!\n\n我之前写过看好半导体股，看好PLUG，以及。\n看跌CLOV，并且在大多数情况下对这些都是正确的（任何人都会有这样的想法）。\n遵循这些剧目应该已经做了tendies:] 。).\n\n对于迪斯尼$DIS，我看到它打200，也许... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"華特-迪士尼公司，多板塊玩法$DIS。","the_new_excerpt":"小編給大家寫一篇迪士尼的波段好戲!\n\n我之前寫過看好半導體股，看好PLUG，以及。\n看跌CLOV，並且在大多數情況下對這些都是正確的（任何人都會有這樣的想法）。\n遵循這些劇目應該已經做了tendies:] 。).\n\n對於迪斯尼$DIS，我看到它打200，也許... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mn85mv","excerpt":"I've often heard recommendations of keeping x% of your savings in stocks.
