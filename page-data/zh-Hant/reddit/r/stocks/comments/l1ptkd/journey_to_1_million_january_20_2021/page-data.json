Mostly due to tech stocks running up from the Biden inauguration.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind I started with $313,000 last year and ended with $650,000 before I switched over to Webull.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Watchlist</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>$BABA</strong>- Opened above the 180 MA with Jack Ma&#39;s reappearance. This one could be a very interesting buy if it forms a strong upwards trend. However, be careful. Don&#39;t assume because Ma is back online, means everything is ok. With Chinese New Year, China&#39;s biggest holiday, coming up, Alibaba has potential for huge profit. $BABA is up 5.5% today and will run up to $300 and more eventually. The biggest question is time. Alibaba is an ecommerce giant that is paramount in every single Chinese persons&#39; lives. On one hand, Ma has a big mouth; he shouldn&#39;t speak out against the CCP so tread with caution. On the other hand, there isn&#39;t much negative news in China against Alibaba currently. Sales on the ecommerce giant is business as usual.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Price Target - <em>$300</em></li>\n<li>Entry - Buy <em>$270 and below</em></li>\n<li>Risk 1-5 - <em>2</em></li>\n<li>Timeframe - 2-4 months</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>$THCX</strong> - I will be buying at least 100 shares of this cannabis ETF and selling covered calls next week. Decriminalization is imminent and a vote is near. Legalization is a possibility in this administration although I don&#39;t think it would come anytime soon.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Price Target - <em>$25</em></li>\n<li>Entry - Buy <em>$17 and below</em></li>\n<li>Risk 1-5 - 4</li>\n<li>Timeframe - 1-3 months</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>$PRNT</strong> - 3D Printing ETF managed by ARK Invest. This is gaining more popularity online, and anything ARK is and has been very, very successful. Personally, I want to hold this long term - for years. For now though, I&#39;ll be selling covered calls. This one is a little more expensive to acquire 100 shares - around $4000.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Price Target - <em>$46</em></li>\n<li>Entry - Buy <em>$38 and below</em></li>\n<li>Risk 1-5 - 3</li>\n<li>Timeframe - 4-6 weeks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>$SURF</strong> - Surface Oncology is an ARK Invest baby that is clinical stage immuno-oncology company that is engaged in the development of cancer immunotherapies. ARK manager, Cathie Woods, has helped us make a lot of money so it is hard not to take a close look at this stock. Only $14, you can buy 100 shares for $1400 and start selling covered calls with me next week.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Price Target - <em>$22</em></li>\n<li>Entry - Buy <em>$14 and below</em></li>\n<li>Risk 1-5 - 3.5</li>\n<li>Timeframe - 2-4 months</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Trading Charts and original Post:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prostockadvice.com/post/journey-to-1-million-january-20-2021\">https://www.prostockadvice.com/post/journey-to-1-million-january-20-2021</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l1ptkd/journey_to_1_million_january_20_2021/","title":"Journey to $1 Million - January 20, 2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-21T06:58:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-21 06:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l1ptkd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l1ptkd/journey_to_1_million_january_20_2021/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l1ptkd/journey_to_1_million_january_20_2021/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"prostockadvice","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/prostockadvice","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"prostockadvice","score":90,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"100万美元之旅--2021年1月20日。","the_new_excerpt":"我的投资组合今天涨了7.5%，也就是5万块钱。主要是由于科技股票上涨\n从拜登就职典礼。\n\n请记住，我去年以313,000美元起家，最后以650,000美元收场，然后我才。\n换成了Webull。\n\n观察列表\n\n阿里巴巴--开盘在180MA上方，马云再次出现。这个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"100萬美元之旅--2021年1月20日。","the_new_excerpt":"我的投資組合今天漲了7.5%，也就是5萬塊錢。主要是由於科技股票上漲\n從拜登就職典禮。\n\n請記住，我去年以313,000美元起家，最後以650,000美元收場，然後我才。\n換成了Webull。\n\n觀察列表\n\n阿里巴巴--開盤在180MA上方，馬雲再次出現。這個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lab340","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab340/billionaire_investor_mark_cuban_says_reddit_stock/","title":"Billionaire Investor Mark Cuban Says Reddit Stock Traders Have ‘Every Right To Kick Wall Street’s Ass’ - All Hail Wise Cuban Man!","date":"February 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"亿万富翁投资者马克-库班说，Reddit股票交易员 \"完全有权利踢华尔街的屁股\"--聪明的库班人万岁!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"億萬富翁投資者馬克-庫班說，Reddit股票交易員 \"完全有權利踢華爾街的屁股\"--聰明的庫班人萬歲!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lae1ox","excerpt":"Latest from Reuters\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-investing-robinhood-debt-exclu/exclusive-robinhood-explores-raising-more-debt-to-fulfill-reddit-fueled-order-frenzy-sources-idUSKBN2A13HG]\nis they are looking for another $1bn on-top of the $3.4bn raised in the last few\ndays.\n\nIf the…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lae1ox/is_robinhood_raising_billions_of_cash_a_worrying/","title":"Is Robinhood raising billions of cash a worrying sign?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 01, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Robinhood筹集数十亿现金是一个令人担忧的信号吗？","the_new_excerpt":"路透社的最新报道\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-investing-robinhood-debt-exclu/exclusive-robinhood-explores-raising-more-debt-to-fulfill-reddit-fueled-order-frenzy-sources-idUSKBN2A13HG]\n是他们在过去几个月筹集的34亿美元的基础上，再寻找10亿美元。\n天。\n\n如果...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Robinhood籌集數十億現金是一個令人擔憂的信號嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"路透社的最新報道\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-investing-robinhood-debt-exclu/exclusive-robinhood-explores-raising-more-debt-to-fulfill-reddit-fueled-order-frenzy-sources-idUSKBN2A13HG]\n是他們在過去幾個月籌集的34億美元的基礎上，再尋找10億美元。\n天。\n\n如果...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l1ptkd","previousId":"RedditPost-lab340","nextId":"RedditPost-lae1ox","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l1ptkd/journey_to_1_million_january_20_2021/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
