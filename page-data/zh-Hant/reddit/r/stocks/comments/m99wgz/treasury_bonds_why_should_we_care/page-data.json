Then I will pose some questions for discussion as I do not fully understand how this will affect the market. </p>\n\n<p>When you buy Bonds you are buying US Government debt. The Yield is how much interest the Bond pays. Yield is determined by supply and demand of the Bonds. When the Pandemic hit people apparently flocked to Bonds because they are a safe investment and this buying drove down the Bond Yield. The Bond Yield causes other interest rates (mortgages, loans, credit cards) to follow its rise or fall. Since the Yield went down so did interest rates, this caused a boom in the stock market (along with stimulus) because business could borrow money for less. </p>\n\n<p>Currently, Bonds have been selling off which increases the Yield. This increases interest rates making businesses dependent on cheap lending, like Tech, to fall in price. Bonds are selling off because people are expecting inflation to increase with a hotter economy and it doesn’t make sense to have money tied to low yield bonds when inflation is greater than the Bond Yield. </p>\n\n<p>So now the stock market is going through a period of volatility because of the Bond sell off and uncertainty about inflation. To ease this uncertainty investors have wanted the Fed to announce Yield Curve Control (YCC). Basically, the Fed buys Bonds to keep the Yield at a desired rate. So far it looks like the Fed isn’t worried about the rates right now and want to see more sustainable economic growth before doing anything with rates. </p>\n\n<p>Questions for discussion:\nWhy would the markets react poorly to rising Yield? I get that it’s more expensive to finance debt but won’t the Bond sellers most likely move money into the stock market?</p>\n\n<p>The Fed wants inflation, and inflation fears have driven a Bond sell off. If the Fed gets their inflation target and it doesn’t go out of control than shouldn’t markets calm down? I see no reason the Fed would loose control, they have so many more tools than they ever have before. </p>\n\n<p>If the market is doomed to be stifled because of all this where is a good place to move money? Obviously all stocks won’t suck and many have already started the rotation into value and emerging markets.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m99wgz/treasury_bonds_why_should_we_care/","title":"Treasury Bonds, why should we care?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-20T22:40:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-20 22:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m99wgz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m99wgz/treasury_bonds_why_should_we_care/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m99wgz/treasury_bonds_why_should_we_care/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"anth1986","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/anth1986","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"anth1986","score":70,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"国债，我们为什么要关心？","the_new_excerpt":"我先简单介绍一下债券的情况，以及它们又是如何\n影响股票。那么我将提出一些问题供大家讨论，因为我没有完全的\n了解这将如何影响市场。\n\n当你购买债券时，你购买的是美国政府的债务。收益率是多少\n债券支付的利息....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"國債，我們爲什麼要關心？","the_new_excerpt":"我先簡單介紹一下債券的情況，以及它們又是如何\n影響股票。那麼我將提出一些問題供大家討論，因爲我沒有完全的\n瞭解這將如何影響市場。\n\n當你購買債券時，你購買的是美國政府的債務。收益率是多少\n債券支付的利息....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mq0udn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mq0udn/blackberry_and_ibm_canada_establish_a_new/","title":"BlackBerry and IBM Canada Establish a New Partnership $BB","date":"April 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"BlackBerryとIBM Canadaが新たなパートナーシップを確立 $BB","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"黑莓与IBM加拿大公司建立新的合作关系$BB","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"黑莓與IBM加拿大公司建立新的合作關係$BB","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mq2lmr","excerpt":"Link:https://currency.com/cyber-security-firm-darktrace-aims-for-4bn-london-ipo\n\nBritish cyber security firm Darktrace has announced plans of a London\nlisting said to value the company at £3bn ($4.1bn, €3.4bn).\n\nBacked by tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch, the company was founded in 2013\nin Cambridge, UK…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mq2lmr/cyber_security_firm_darktrace_aims_for_4bn_london/","title":"Cyber security firm Darktrace aims for $4bn London IPO","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 14, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"サイバーセキュリティ企業Darktrace、ロンドンで40億ドルのIPOを目指す","the_new_excerpt":"リンク:https://currency.com/cyber-security-firm-darktrace-aims-for-4bn-london-ipo\n\n英国のサイバーセキュリティ企業であるDarktraceは、ロンドンでの上場を計画していることを発表しました。\n同社の価値は30億ポンド（41億ドル、34億ユーロ）になると言われています。\n\nテクノロジー企業家のマイク・リンチが支援する同社は、2013年にカンブルガーで設立されました。\nイギリスのケンブリッジで設立されました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"网络安全公司Darktrace瞄准40亿美元伦敦IPO","the_new_excerpt":"链接：https://currency.com/cyber-security-firm-darktrace-aims-for-4bn-london-ipo\n\n英国网络安全公司Darktrace宣布了在伦敦的计划。\n上市，据说该公司估值为30亿英镑（41亿美元，34亿欧元）。\n\n由科技企业家迈克-林奇(Mike Lynch)支持，该公司成立于2013年。\n在英国剑桥...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"網絡安全公司Darktrace瞄準40億美元倫敦IPO","the_new_excerpt":"鏈接：https://currency.com/cyber-security-firm-darktrace-aims-for-4bn-london-ipo\n\n英國網絡安全公司Darktrace宣佈了在倫敦的計劃。\n上市，據說該公司估值爲30億英鎊（41億美元，34億歐元）。\n\n由科技企業家邁克-林奇(Mike Lynch)支持，該公司成立於2013年。\n在英國劍橋...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m99wgz","previousId":"RedditPost-mq0udn","nextId":"RedditPost-mq2lmr","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m99wgz/treasury_bonds_why_should_we_care/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
