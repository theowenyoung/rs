Today I want to talk to you about what’s really going on in the stock market and what we should expected next…</p>\n\n<p><strong>[Don&#39;t: Read Very Long Post | Dislike Before Reading]</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, in the last couple of weeks, we have seen a very fast correction in the tech heavy Nasdaq <a href=\"https://imgur.com/aK26hjA\">Index</a> after the bond yields rapidly spiked over 1.5% for the 10y, as a lot of investors kept getting spooked by the employment numbers coming in slightly better than expected, though many important things are still hidden in those numbers.</p>\n\n<p>For example, last week we saw the US gaining almost 400K jobs, but this barely moved the unemployment <a href=\"https://imgur.com/7PJTWUA\">rate</a> which still stands at 6.2% (and this doesn’t even include people who just quit searching for jobs). Almost all of the job <a href=\"https://imgur.com/B3av5gb\">gains</a> were seen in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has started to regain some momentum after it was the most affected by the events of last year, as this sector is still down more than 3.5M jobs since a year ago.</p>\n\n<p>These past weeks we also <a href=\"https://imgur.com/yeudkin\">saw</a> jobless claims continuing to go down, with the latest initial jobless claims coming in at the lowest level since last early last year at just over 700K, as the continuing jobless claims also coming in at just over 4.1M.</p>\n\n<p>But guys, regardless of the jobs &amp; unemployment numbers, the main thing that will keep investors on edge will continue to be treasury <a href=\"https://imgur.com/rDjy9fO\">yields</a>, the interest rates and how this are affected by the inflation <a href=\"https://imgur.com/awXUGgw\">numbers</a> which are expected to see a huge bump in the next months as we will have very low comps compared to last year when we saw the rona starting to pick up steam.</p>\n\n<p>We can see <a href=\"https://imgur.com/QbuiSot\">here</a> the core inflation came lower this month with an increase of just .1% which jolted the stock market and started a recovery after the sell-off in the past weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Given that tech names &amp; EVs were some of the biggest hit stocks we should also take a quick look at NIO, as the company lost almost half of its value in the past month, dropping from over $66 to just $35 after the big sell off in the past weeks.</p>\n\n<p>NIO’s drop was also amplified probably by the fact that they posted mixed <a href=\"https://imgur.com/t0jRJEW\">results</a> for the 4th quarter of last year, as they just missed the top line but did manage to post a solid beat on the company’s bottom line, losing just $0.14/share.</p>\n\n<p>Investors might not have been happy to see a guidance of just 15% above their 4th quarter given the huge valuation and expectations of the company and the huge global chip shortage that will limit NIO’s production capacity to just 7.5K/month in the 2nd quarter of 2021.</p>\n\n<p>I still have a mixed opinion about NIO’s stock, but after this huge sell-off, it has become more attractive given the continued <a href=\"https://imgur.com/cI1TNWJ\">growth</a> of sales the company has seen in the last years, while I also believe NIO will remain one of the winners of the EV disruption.</p>\n\n<p>The other stock that I wanted to mention after what has happened in the past weeks is Zoom.</p>\n\n<p>I really like Zoom’s products and I understand the hype of the stock, but I also really believe they will struggle to keep the huge growth rate going, as the company might have seen its peak growth after the massive work-from-home movement in 2020.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/UygZxJZ\">Zoom</a> also reported a beat on the top &amp; bottom line and I expect them to continue to have another great first half to start 2021, but after that, the company will have very though comps to go against, which might really put some downward pressure on the stock, especially as more people go back to their workplaces.</p>\n\n<p>You can see, even the company doesn’t expect the huge growth to continue, with the revenue growth expected to only slightly continue to grow during 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Zoom is valued at almost $100B which is really hard to justify unless the company continues to innovate and bring more &amp; more products to the market, as the industry they operate in will only become more competitive over time with other big players like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce &amp; many others looking to take market share.</p>\n\n<p>Guys, if you are still in doubt about what to do next in the stock market, you should just take a look at the chart below and start thinking long term, because investing, if you are really looking to make money is all about the long-term.</p>\n\n<p>You can see <a href=\"https://imgur.com/ZlO593t\">HERE</a> in the past 100 years we&#39;ve had 8 bear markets previous to the one we saw in 2020, with the average bear market lasting just 1.4years compared to over 9 years for every bull market with a staggering difference in gains vs losses as well.</p>\n\n<p>We can also see in this <a href=\"https://imgur.com/wM39iSQ\">chart</a> that it only took 15 days for the Nasdaq to enter a 10% correction this time, but you can see the average 12 month return after a 10% correction is almost 30% which is huge, with the likelihood of the index posting a positive return in the next 12 months standing at over 90%</p>\n\n<p>So, given that we had a bear market last year, I believe it’s highly unlikely that we will see a huge drop in stocks even if yields continue to rise, as the real return of the treasury yields will continue to be close to 0, as I don’t expect them to jump more than 2% for the 10y anytime soon.</p>\n\n<p>Moving on, I recently saw some <a href=\"https://imgur.com/I3ijkKT\">comments</a> made by David Tepper which I wasn’t really aware of but which made a lot of sense to me, he highlighted that the other downward pressure put on treasury yields, which will keep them in check, will come from investors in other countries like Japan, Germany &amp; many others, as the US treasuries have become way more attractive than others.</p>\n\n<p>One other thing that I think should be mentioned is that the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/undefined\">Dow Jones</a> has continued to make new high after new high in the past week, being led by companies like Disney which has just surpassed 100M <a href=\"https://imgur.com/fCTDNGX\">subscribers</a> on their Disney+ platform while also getting a boost from their other revenue streams starting to come back online, and of course the stock that has led the DOW in the past week, Boeing, as the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/K6SPGY1\">company</a> had more sales than cancellations for the first time since November 2019 as the 737 MAX crisis is finally starting to fade away for the company, with even more possible <a href=\"https://imgur.com/4XYgfs9\">deals</a> likely to close in the next period, as airlines start to have a better view of what the future will bring for them.</p>\n\n<p>Friends, you shouldn’t be scared of stock market corrections or dips as we have <a href=\"https://imgur.com/74dAwZO\">seen</a> a 10% pullback once every 11 months as you can see, with the frequency of bigger crashes decreasing significantly, but as always, because we are highly emotional beings, it’s very hard for us to handle our emotions after a series of red days.</p>\n\n<p>You should remember though, most often than not, the best way to go is just to ride out the dip and even starting deploying more cash into the stock market the more it drops. I think you should develop a strategy of not selling on big red days and deploying an increasingly higher % of your cash into great stocks the more the stock market drops.</p>\n\n<p>I also fully expect some part of the next stimulus check, which was just signed by Biden, to end up in the stock market, which might help push the stock market on the right path despite increasing pressures from rising yields and possible short-term inflation fears.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So just to end this post guys, is the stock market going to crash? My short answer is NO!</strong></p>\n\n<p>I don’t expect that to happen any time soon. Even if we continue to see volatility in the stock market you should use that to your advantage and smartly deploy cash into great companies, which leads me to my other question, should you buy stocks today? Well, at the moment of writing this post, futures are currently trending down pre-market (SP &amp; Nasdaq in the Red, Dow +0.2%) and If they continue to do so it might be a good chance to deploy some cash, but don’t rush into the first red day you see, slowly build your positions or add to them. As a rule of thumb, I like to buy more once a 5% dip occurs in the stock market and slowly deploy cash the more it drops.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you everyone for reading🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!
