Here&#39;s the evidence:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Valuation:</strong> The CAPE smoothed P/E multiple has <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/indicators/cyclically_adjusted_pe_ratio\">expanded</a> for six straight months. It bottomed at 24.8 in March at the price index trough, closed December at 33.7, then to 34.5 in January, and now to 34.8 in February. <em>By way of comparison, the multiple was 32.3 in March 2001, as the tech wreck bear market really got going; and 32.6 in September 1929</em>. Investors always think they can get out before the peak is in. History rhymes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leverage:</strong> Margin debt has soared 42% from a year ago (+115% at an annual rate over the past three months alone). This is exactly what the trend was in August 2007 and September 2000. <em>Right near the market peaks.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Positioning:</strong> The put-call volume ratio has been below 0.60 with near consistency since the middle of November. It’s a stretch we haven’t seen in over eight years. The BofA survey shows that global portfolio managers are running with the lowest cash levels in eight years, and have the highest exposures to equities and commodities in a decade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technicals:</strong> The fact that the S&amp;P 500 is now 13% above its 200-day moving average is an extreme gap worth noting and monitoring — it was 11% back in February 2000, just ahead of the tech mania bust and 7% in October 2018, ahead of the near-20% drawdown heading into the end of that year.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lwf36b/us_companies_that_make_no_money_have_seen_their/","title":"US companies that make no money have seen their stock prices soar 19% YTD, outperforming those that *are* profitable by 15 points...
