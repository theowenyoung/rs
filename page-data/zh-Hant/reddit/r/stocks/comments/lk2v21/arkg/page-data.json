I currently hold ten percent ARKK and wanted to put another 5 percent in another ARK fund and was hoping for ARKG. However when I go through the weightings of ARKG&#39;s holdings it seems they are a lot of small and medium cap companies. My worry is that ARK owns around ten percent of these companies and this is quite a risky play.</p>\n\n<p>Does ARKG manage too much money for them to achieve what they want to do in ARKG or is my logic flawed. I truly believe genomics is a great ten year strategy but is this fund too big to be nimble enough to navigate this volatile area? I notice recently they are buying into bigger pharma companies (Roche, Takeda, Nov) is this just to park cash or is there an actual genomics play here. A quick glance at their pipeline I couldn&#39;t find much.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for clearing this up as I&#39;m quite new to this.</p>\n\n<p>I also used <a href=\"https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php\">https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php</a> to find out the fund overlaps</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lk2v21/arkg/","title":"ARKG","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T08:38:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 08:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lk2v21","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lk2v21/arkg/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lk2v21/arkg/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Gucci_Bane_","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gucci_Bane_","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Gucci_Bane_","score":84,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ARKG","the_new_excerpt":"ARKG权重\n\n嘿，我对这些ARK基金比较陌生。我目前持有10%的ARKK和\n想再投5%到另一只ARK基金，并希望能投ARKG。\n然而当我翻看ARKG的持股比重时，似乎他们是一\n很多中小市值的公司。我的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARKG","the_new_excerpt":"ARKG權重\n\n嘿，我對這些ARK基金比較陌生。我目前持有10%的ARKK和\n想再投5%到另一隻ARK基金，並希望能投ARKG。\n然而當我翻看ARKG的持股比重時，似乎他們是一\n很多中小市值的公司。我的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lv95w9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lv95w9/melvin_cheated/","title":"MELVIN CHEATED","date":"March 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"梅尔文欺骗","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"梅爾文欺騙","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1366406005479919617","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1366406005479919617","title":"That 3 day bear market was brutal","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 01, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"那3天的熊市是残酷的","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"那3天的熊市是殘酷的","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lk2v21","previousId":"RedditPost-lv95w9","nextId":"TweetPost-1366406005479919617","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lk2v21/arkg/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
