I’m just trying to get some help understanding the macro-economic factors that could lead to this seemingly impossible situation. </p>\n\n<p>Live Nation is one of the largest live event promoters in the world. They own Ticketmaster and a slew of live event venues across the world. Due to the pandemic, their business has essentially ground to a halt with revenues down over 95% YoY. Despite this, their stock price is currently trading at or above their pre-pandemic levels.</p>\n\n<p>The company has a significant amount of cash on hand at 2.63B with a quarterly burn around 500M. So it is unlikely the company will completely fold unless the pandemic is extended for many years. But still, I don’t understand how the valuation of this company by the market could be so high. Once live events do come back, wouldn’t the company be in a significantly worse financial position than before pandemic because of the huge amount of cash burned? Wouldn’t it make sense for this weaker future position to be priced into the stock now?</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the potentially dumb question. I’m new to investing and can’t really wrap my head around this one. What do people see in this stock that I am missing?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks so much!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kboh0h/eli5_how_can_the_price_for_live_nation_a_concert/","title":"ELI5 - How can the price for Live Nation, a concert venue and live event promoter, be at or above pre-pandemic levels when revenues are down 95%?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"December 14, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-14T11:28:18.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-14 11:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kboh0h","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kboh0h/eli5_how_can_the_price_for_live_nation_a_concert/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kboh0h/eli5_how_can_the_price_for_live_nation_a_concert/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"purple_kool_aid","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/purple_kool_aid","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"purple_kool_aid","score":407,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ELI5-当收入下降95%时，演唱会场地和现场活动推广者Live Nation的价格怎么可能达到或高于大流行前的水平？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。我只是想寻求一些帮助来理解宏观经济\n可能导致这一看似不可能的情况的因素。\n\nLive Nation是世界上最大的现场活动推广者之一。他们拥有\nTicketmaster和世界各地的许多现场活动场地。由于…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ELI5-當收入下降95%時，演唱會場地和現場活動推廣者Live Nation的價格怎麼可能達到或高於大流行前的水平？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。我只是想尋求一些幫助來理解宏觀經濟\n可能導致這一看似不可能的情況的因素。\n\nLive Nation是世界上最大的現場活動推廣者之一。他們擁有\nTicketmaster和世界各地的許多現場活動場地。由於…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kxfz73","excerpt":"Here’s what Biden calls for:\n\nDirect payments of $1,400 to most Americans, bringing the total relief to $2,000\nincluding December’s $600 payments\n\nIncreasing the federal, per-week unemployment benefit to $400 and extend it\nthrough the end of September\n\nIncreasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxfz73/biden_19t_plan_unveiled_we_will_have_to_wait/","title":"Biden 1.9T Plan Unveiled - We will have to wait until February for any supposed Infrastructure Plan.
