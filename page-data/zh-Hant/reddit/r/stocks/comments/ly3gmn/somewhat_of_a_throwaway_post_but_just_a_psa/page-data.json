Everyone seems to think that they are all gurus in trading, and they have the &quot;right&quot; answer. But, the reality is that there are over 1mil+ different ways to trade and be successful. It varies greatly depending on how &quot;active&quot; you are in your portfolio. Some people are in there 50 times per day, others maybe 1-2 times per month. What works for one person might not work for another, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Just because someone has an annual target over 10% doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re crazy. Maybe they are in the group that checks their portfolio 50 times per day, and they flip stocks rapidly in the short-term for compounded gains. You think Wall Street day-job traders would accept only a 10% gain per year? lol... Just because someone only invests in blue-chips and not micro-cap stocks &quot;going to the moon!&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t like money. Maybe they just prefer less risk.</p>\n\n<p>In short, it&#39;s important to remember that people all are doing very different strategies. There is no single correct answer. Perhaps before assuming anything, people should ask/clarify their approaches first. I normally try to provide my specifics at least in the body of the original post, however I still find that many people skip that part, or just don&#39;t agree with it, and then proceed to name-calling, ridiculing, and everything besides actually offering clarity or advice.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re a great community here, and I appreciate all of you! But please, whenever possible let&#39;s work to ask questions and ask for clarity instead of assuming things and being un-helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Happy trading!!!! (and plz stay positive because we all know the last 3 weeks haven&#39;t been fun, but they will turn around soon, haha!)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ly3gmn/somewhat_of_a_throwaway_post_but_just_a_psa/","title":"Somewhat of a throw-away post, but just a PSA, please remember that not everyone trades the same way.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T13:24:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 13:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ly3gmn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ly3gmn/somewhat_of_a_throwaway_post_but_just_a_psa/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ly3gmn/somewhat_of_a_throwaway_post_but_just_a_psa/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"lightband101","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lightband101","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"lightband101","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"有点抛砖引玉的意思，但只是一个公益广告，请记住，不是每个人的交易方式都一样。","the_new_excerpt":"这个社区一直在提供分析、建议和大量的帮助。\n有益的资源，话虽如此，但我已经注意到了一些有毒的地方。\n子reddit以及。大家似乎都认为他们都是交易方面的大师。\n而且他们有 \"正确 \"的答案。但是，现实是，有... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有點拋磚引玉的意思，但只是一個公益廣告，請記住，不是每個人的交易方式都一樣。","the_new_excerpt":"這個社區一直在提供分析、建議和大量的幫助。\n有益的資源，話雖如此，但我已經注意到了一些有毒的地方。\n子reddit以及。大家似乎都認爲他們都是交易方面的大師。\n而且他們有 \"正確 \"的答案。但是，現實是，有... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m9h2kx","excerpt":"Robinhood\n[https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q4%202020.pdf]\n\nTD Ameritrade\n[https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/606_disclosure/tdainc-TDA2055-q4-2020.pdf]\n\nE*Trade…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m9h2kx/comparing_payment_for_order_flow_routing_reports/","title":"Comparing payment for order flow routing reports (606a) of different brokerages","date":"March 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"比较不同经纪公司的订单流动路线报告(606a)的付款情况。","the_new_excerpt":"Robinhood\n[https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q4%202020.pdf]\n\nTD Ameritrade\n[https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/606_disclosure/tdainc-TDA2055-q4-2020.pdf]\n\nE*Trade...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"比較不同經紀公司的訂單流動路線報告(606a)的付款情況。","the_new_excerpt":"Robinhood\n[https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q4%202020.pdf]\n\nTD Ameritrade\n[https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/606_disclosure/tdainc-TDA2055-q4-2020.pdf]\n\nE*Trade...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m9uq3i","excerpt":"TL;DR Downvote bots, shills and media FUD are an obvious sledgehammer for\npaperhands.
