Today&#39;s pre-market was no exception. With my average being around $2.8, I was a little nervous today to go red. BUT an interesting thing happened. I noticed that my broker indicated that from 9:30 today until 20:00 Feb 16 this stuck is traded under SEC 201 rule, meaning that short sellers are not allowed to sell under the highest bid price. It is interesting twhat this simple rule unveiled about this stock: that it is not going down because there is something wrong with the fundamentals, but it is going down because short-sellers are forcing it to. As soon as this rule was executed, the stock started going back up to $3.7 (as of now) from $2.80 in the first 5 minutes of the market (before Rule 201 was imposed and it was going down hard with heavy volume [aka short sellers]). This means that there are more bulls than bears behind this stock, right?</p>\n\n<p>Since I am planning on keeping my position open for the long run, I want to make sure if my understanding of what happened today is right. What do you think?</p>\n\n<p>As another example in contrast to this one, the same thing happened to AEZS on Feb 9 or 10, after a spike in price. But this time the price kept going down, meaning that the price was too high even for the bulls. Is that a correct way to think about this? I appreciate your feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: Please keep in mind that this is not financial advice. I am long $ATOS 3,000@$2.8.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention I added a limit sell order of $50.00 to prevent my shares from being lent to short sellers. The idea of short selling makes no sense at all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lie29h/sec_rule_201_aka_uptick_rule_and_how_to_recognize/","title":"SEC Rule 201 (aka \"up-tick\" rule) and how to recognize a healthy stock","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T18:18:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 18:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lie29h","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lie29h/sec_rule_201_aka_uptick_rule_and_how_to_recognize/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lie29h/sec_rule_201_aka_uptick_rule_and_how_to_recognize/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"cyclingmania","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cyclingmania","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"cyclingmania","score":94,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"证监会规则201（又称 \"涨停板 \"规则）及如何识别健康的股票。","the_new_excerpt":"我看到我最喜欢的股票$ATOS整个星期都是红色的。今天的\n前市也不例外。由于我的平均水平在2.8元左右，我有些\n今天紧张的走红。但一件有趣的事情发生了。我注意到，我的\n经纪人表示，从今天9:30到2月16日20:00，这个卡住的是... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"證監會規則201（又稱 \"漲停板 \"規則）及如何識別健康的股票。","the_new_excerpt":"我看到我最喜歡的股票$ATOS整個星期都是紅色的。今天的\n前市也不例外。由於我的平均水平在2.8元左右，我有些\n今天緊張的走紅。但一件有趣的事情發生了。我注意到，我的\n經紀人表示，從今天9:30到2月16日20:00，這個卡住的是... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lswo3e","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lswo3e/been_holding_in_japansouth_korea_lets_go_to_the/","title":"Been holding in Japan/South Korea.
