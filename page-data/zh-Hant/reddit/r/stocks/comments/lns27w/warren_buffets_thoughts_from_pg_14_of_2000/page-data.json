By shamelessly merchandising birdless bushes, promoters have in recent years moved billions of dollars from the pockets of the public to their own purses (and to those of their friends and associates). The fact is that a bubble market has allowed the creation of bubble companies, entities designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for them. Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company’s promoters. At bottom, the “business model” for these companies has been the old-fashioned chain letter, for which many fee-hungry investment bankers acted as eager postmen.  </p>\n\n<p>But a pin lies in wait for every bubble. And when the two eventually meet, a new wave of investors learns some very old lessons: First, many in Wall Street ¾ a community in which quality control is not prized ¾ will sell investors anything they will buy. Second, speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Warren Buffet wrote this in his year 2000 shareholder letter, which I read for the first time today. It was interesting as it might be something to consider and think about as we continue to fly high. I don&#39;t profess to knowing anything about valuations, but clearly we have been doing quite well for quite some time. I, for one, am not intelligent enough to try and beat the market so I just DCA into boring ETFs and funds and am satisfied doing so, but nonetheless, these paragraphs were interesting to me as it seemed to be potentially relevant to all of the news that has been coming out lately.  </p>\n\n<p>With so many new traders and so much more ease of access to the world of finance, hopefully, we see even more transparency and ease of access to information, as well. As I continue to learn and understand more I find there is an increased need for the great input and sharing of ideas that a community like this can provide.   </p>\n\n<p>I am interested to know if you all think we are at risk of, yet again, replicating what Buffet spoke of in 2000.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lns27w/warren_buffets_thoughts_from_pg_14_of_2000/","title":"Warren Buffet's thoughts from pg 14 of 2000 shareholder letter","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T06:22:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 06:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lns27w","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lns27w/warren_buffets_thoughts_from_pg_14_of_2000/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lns27w/warren_buffets_thoughts_from_pg_14_of_2000/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"fpsoneone","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/fpsoneone","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"fpsoneone","score":65,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1367877321563267072","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1367877321563267072","title":"The sell-off in high momentum stocks over the past few weeks is more than 3x larger than the broad market.\n\nThis is the sharpest momentum downturn on a relative basis that we've seen in quite some time.\n\n$MTUM $SPY\n\nCharting via @ycharts https://t.co/WjYEabEv8j","date":"March 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"过去几周高动量股的抛售幅度是大盘的3倍多。\n\n这是我们在相当长一段时间内看到的相对基础上最剧烈的动量下跌。\n\n$MTUM $SPY\n\n通过@ycharts绘制图表 https://t.co/WjYEabEv8j","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"過去幾周高動量股的拋售幅度是大盤的3倍多。\n\n這是我們在相當長一段時間內看到的相對基礎上最劇烈的動量下跌。\n\n$MTUM $SPY\n\n通過@ycharts繪製圖表 https://t.co/WjYEabEv8j","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1367833524594634752","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1367833524594634752","title":"Have now launched Occasio Capital Ltd as an independent research firm, seeking to publish jargon-free equity research for retail investors.
