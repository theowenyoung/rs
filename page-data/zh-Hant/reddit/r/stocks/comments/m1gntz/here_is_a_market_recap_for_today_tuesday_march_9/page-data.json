The move marked a stark reversal after the index sank into a correction by the close of Monday&#39;s session, plunging a total of more than 10% from a recent record closing high. Goes to show how volatile the market can be. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.42% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.10% up.</p>\n\n<p>The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant’s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. </p>\n\n<p>The Treasury yield pulled back a little but remains at elevated levels, which was pressuring equity markets, particularly tech stocks, in recent weeks. . Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today&#39;s dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. </p>\n\n<p>Courtney Dominguez, Payne Capital Management Senior Wealth Advisor said, “This is a trend that tends to happen as we get out of a recession: You tend to see stocks move towards cyclical. So things like value companies or small caps, things like energy, tend to do really well when you’re coming out of a recession. And what happened last year is, those tech companies were really doing so well that their prices were getting extremely high. I don’t think these companies are going away. I think a lot of these are going to be things that we continue to have in our workplaces going forward. But the question is, are these companies so expensive, is all the optimism already priced in?”</p>\n\n<p>Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shares of Gamestop (GME) performed strongly again today, rising around 25% at the time of writing.</li>\n<li>Roblox is set to go public tomorrow via direct listing, ticker will be RBLX.

Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not risk, but it is an opportunity.
