I have seen a lot of people on many posts saying that ‘they have done they DD’ which honestly is probably 30 mins on checking Reddit and Stocktwits for bullish sentiments instead of really downloading and reading the company’s financial records, future growth prospects etc. </p>\n\n<p>I think it is a good time to evaluate if your stock can handle a huge drop in price and still allows you to have conviction to keep holding. A lot of stocks are down 20-30%+ or more from their ATHs at this point, and if a crash or correction does happen (I believe NASDAQ is at or very near correction territory at about -10% from ATH), it’s going to see one crazy drop of -10-30% in a single day just like what happened in March. </p>\n\n<p>Can you handle it? If you can, the stock is a conviction pick for you. If not, perhaps consider buying something that you have truly done DD in. I have certain holdings that I believe to be dangerous when a correction or crash comes, like NIO, NET and JD (NET and JD have a growing consumer base and they will continue to grow, but at current market cap I deem it to be dangerous. NIO is super dangerous but it’s house money at this point since I got in at 15$ and sold more than half at 44$ long ago) But I got them at prices low enough to be able to withstand it even if they dropped more, they are a smaller % of my portfolio and I am willing to risk a loss for a more aggressive approach. </p>\n\n<p>I also have holdings which I will definitely add more if a crash does happen,like MWK and DIS. Tech is never going to be irrelevant after Covid, the transition to value stocks is temporary and it’s clear to me, so I am still ever so bullish on tech stocks and e-commerce. </p>\n\n<p>It’s obvious no one can be unaffected when you see your NLV drop, and that much is the same for me. However, at the end of the day, if this stock is something viable for years, buy and hold works, if it was a one time hype, reconsider your approach. I never got into green energy stocks because they are either mostly unprofitable or have no working product. Climate change and all is real, but it takes a lot of time to get there. Oil is still going to be a huge deal for decades regardless and I am quite tired of people having done ‘DD’ in some holdings that do not make any sense. </p>\n\n<p>Part of my holdings are aggressive,which makes it more volatile during a market correction. But ALL of my holdings are at least generating revenue and have a product that is being sold that I personally find to be indicative of what they are accomplish in future. I can never ever buy into a company that makes no revenue and I can only respect the balls of people who buys into such companies because they have strong belief that the company will be successful in that venture. If they buy at a point when the company is still in development, they definitely deserve a much better % in profits. I can never do that personally myself because I am not that ballsy.</p>\n\n<p>The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel is a GREAT book that was released last year and talks about handling your money in the stock market. Please read it if you can, great book, has definitely helped me to manage my emotions in the stock market. No one loves taking a beating everyday, but some things are worth holding on to. </p>\n\n<p>I was there during march and all my holdings took a minimally 27% (I remember this number specifically because I was counting numbers that day) dive in a single day, I never sold and we recovered. It is great to buy and hold, statistics and numbers shows that it beats timing the market, but if only works if the company isn’t some overhyped unicorn crap. Please stay safe everyone and I hope for this to turn positive soon like everyone does. Ultimately, you invest in consideration for your family (especially those married and with kids), so do not put money that you cannot afford to lose. Best of luck to everyone!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lxjbdv/psa_buy_and_hold_only_works_if_the_stock_is/","title":"PSA: Buy and hold only works if the stock is actually good","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-04T13:47:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-04 13:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lxjbdv","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lxjbdv/psa_buy_and_hold_only_works_if_the_stock_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lxjbdv/psa_buy_and_hold_only_works_if_the_stock_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Maverick_WC","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Maverick_WC","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Maverick_WC","score":580,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"PSA：只有当股票真正好的时候，买入并持有才有用","the_new_excerpt":"免责声明：我并不是在预测暴跌或修正，只是在说明\n我的看法是，如果真的发生了。\n\n买入并持有的前提是，你买入的公司有良好的\n基本面，并为未来的持续增长做好准备。我已经看到了很多\n很多帖子上的人说...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"PSA：只有當股票真正好的時候，買入並持有才有用","the_new_excerpt":"免責聲明：我並不是在預測暴跌或修正，只是在說明\n我的看法是，如果真的發生了。\n\n買入並持有的前提是，你買入的公司有良好的\n基本面，併爲未來的持續增長做好準備。我已經看到了很多\n很多帖子上的人說...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m8ji4w","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8ji4w/me_every_time_someone_tells_me_to_sell_gme/","title":"Me every time someone tells me to sell GME","date":"March 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"每次有人叫我卖GME的时候，我都是这样的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"每次有人叫我賣GME的時候，我都是這樣的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m8hqmj","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8hqmj/i_am_just_an_ape_but_i_dont_think_thats_how/","title":"I am just an ape but i don't think that's how percentages work.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 19, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我只是个猿人，但我不认为百分比是这样的。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我只是個猿人，但我不認爲百分比是這樣的。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lxjbdv","previousId":"RedditPost-m8ji4w","nextId":"RedditPost-m8hqmj","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lxjbdv/psa_buy_and_hold_only_works_if_the_stock_is/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
