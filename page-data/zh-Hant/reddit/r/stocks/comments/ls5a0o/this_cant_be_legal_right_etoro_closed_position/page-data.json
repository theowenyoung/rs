This was obviously worrying as the downside risk of my trade had increased a lot; but I still had faith in my decision and watched it climb back into a profit, before I had the chance to sell, Etoro had MORE technical issues, this time locking me out for the entire evening/morning.</p>\n\n<p>When It allowed me back in my trade had been closed just hours before, when the market was well above my stop-loss level.
