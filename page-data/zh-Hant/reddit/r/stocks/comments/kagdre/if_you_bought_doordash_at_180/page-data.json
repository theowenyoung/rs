Let&#39;s take a look at the issues:</p>\n\n<p>1) No moat at all.  Sure they have 50% market share but there are competitors.  They&#39;re a delivery service - anyone can do what they do.  Not only does this pose a risk to market share, but it poses a huge risk to the already thin profit margins.  At some point (because of 2-4 below) they will have to lower their fees and take rate, which will hurt margins even more.</p>\n\n<p>2) No brand value or brand loyalty.  People couldn&#39;t care less who delivers their food, as long as it shows up on time and hot.  Early in COVID I was using Skipthedishes until I got frustrated with poor service so I left.  There is nothing to keep customers loyal to DoorDash if someone else offers better service, or the same service at a better price.</p>\n\n<p>3) Restaurants hate them.  DoorDash takes a huge cut, which forces restaurants to raise their prices.  I posted an example yesterday about a sandwich I ordered that was $13.95 on the restaurant&#39;s online menu but $18.95 on the DoorDash menu.  Restaurants have been using them out of necessity but they are already finding ways around it.  Many restaurants offer customers incentives for picking up their food.  There are reports of restaurants grouping together and doing their own shared delivery.  There are even reports of enterprising people starting their own local delivery services at lower rates.</p>\n\n<p>4) Future growth will plummet.  People have been using this service out of necessity but DoorDash doesn&#39;t provide a service that will permanently change the way people live.  People love eating in restaurants and will flock back to them as soon as it is safe/allowed to do so.  Do you really think that people are going to continue ordering in on weekends through an overpriced delivery service as soon as they can return to restaurants?</p>\n\n<p>5) The CEO reportedly defended the IPO price by saying they priced it at a level they thought fairly reflected the value of the company.  That means the CEO thinks the company is worth ~$100/share.</p>\n\n<p>This IPO was purely a case of ownership taking advantage of timing to raise as much cash as possible.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this thing is trading at $30 a year from now.  This is going to be the FIT or GPRO of 2020 IPOs.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kagdre/if_you_bought_doordash_at_180/","title":"If you bought DoorDash at $180...","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"December 14, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-14T11:28:17.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-14 11:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kagdre","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kagdre/if_you_bought_doordash_at_180/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kagdre/if_you_bought_doordash_at_180/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"SirGasleak","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SirGasleak","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"SirGasleak","score":4034,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果你花180美元买了DoorDash.","the_new_excerpt":"你是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜。让我们来看看这些问题：\n\n1)没有护城河。当然，他们有50%的市场份额，但也有竞争对手。\n他们是送货服务-任何人都可以做他们做的事情。这个姿势不仅是\n这是对市场份额的风险，但对已经很薄的…构成了巨大的风险","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你花180美元買了DoorDash.","the_new_excerpt":"你是個徹頭徹尾的傻瓜。讓我們來看看這些問題：\n\n1)沒有護城河。當然，他們有50%的市場份額，但也有競爭對手。\n他們是送貨服務-任何人都可以做他們做的事情。這個姿勢不僅是\n這是對市場份額的風險，但對已經很薄的…構成了巨大的風險","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-kx50lg","excerpt":"So GameStop jumped big yesterday.
