Even before their decision, $BB is still holding very well. ~1% in the red for most of the day, and once they released no interest rate hikes we spiked ~4% from today&#39;s low. That&#39;s awesome.  </p>\n\n<p>ICYMI - Feds are saying there are no interest rate hikes likely through 2023<br/>\nSOURCE: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html</a>  </p>\n\n<p>What does this mean, you ask?<br/>\nInterest rates are also known as the &quot;price of money&quot;. Low interest means borrowing money is cheap, and if borrowing money is cheap you can take out a loan and make more money with that loan, negating the cost of interest you need to pay per month to the bank.  </p>\n\n<p>For the dumb-dumbs: Money easy to borrow. Borrow money from bank and put money into stock market. Borrowed money easy to repay if stock market go up.   </p>\n\n<p>For ultra-dumb dumb: Replace the word &quot;money&quot; in the sentence above with &quot;banana&quot;. Borrowed money make banana into bigger banana.  </p>\n\n<p>What else happened with $BB what the fuck else do you have to say?<br/>\nLow volume. Extremely low volume. From <a href=\"https://tradingview.com\">tradingview.com</a>, this was the lowest trading day since January 13th. Lowest trading volume in over two months. Why is this relevant?  </p>\n\n<p>We are green on very low volume. Green on low volume means people are accumulating slowly and holding. No/hardly any sellers. I can only assume that this is due to a lot of baggies and that there&#39;s a lot of people interested in having this stock hit that sweet $15 strike price this Friday. I&#39;m currently expecting a lot of volatility in the next couple of days due to:<br/>\n-No interest rate hikes<br/>\n-$BB still holding that strong uptrend<br/>\n-Very tight Bollinger Bands on the daily and hourly<br/>\n-RSI on Daily, 4-hour, Hourly are smack dead in the center. This means we are not overbought so we have room to go up, that being said this also means we can go down.<br/>\n-Triple Witching. Read this if you don&#39;t know what this is.   <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp</a>  </p>\n\n<p>With tight Bollinger Bands, the RSI in the middle the stock is able to go either direction in the next couple of days, and triple witching hour happening this Friday, this means $BB COULD, by technical analysis methods, be very violent. Up or down.  </p>\n\n<p>Right now, for those of you that are long and strong like me, do not worry about tomorrow or Friday if $BB goes down. Daily fluctuations do not matter in the long term.<br/>\nIf $BB spikes, we might see some crazy numbers if it breaks the line at ~14.44.  </p>\n\n<p>Enjoy the rest of your day and I&#39;ll catch you guys on my recap of the week on March 19th.  </p>\n\n<p>Take care.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7b0ta/bb_3172021_green_on_st_patties_day/","title":"$BB 3/17/2021 - Green on St Patties Day","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T01:28:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 01:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m7b0ta","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7b0ta/bb_3172021_green_on_st_patties_day/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7b0ta/bb_3172021_green_on_st_patties_day/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Virtual-Pin1025","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Virtual-Pin1025","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Virtual-Pin1025","score":140,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$BB 3/17/2021 - 圣帕提斯节的绿色活动","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，伙计们!\n\n今天的日子过得很踏实，即使今天由于等待的不确定因素。\n美联储是否加息的决定。甚至在他们\n的决定，$BB仍然持有非常好。今天大部分时间都是红色的~1%。\n而一旦他们发布不加息，我们...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$BB 3/17/2021 - 聖帕提斯節的綠色活動","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，夥計們!\n\n今天的日子過得很踏實，即使今天由於等待的不確定因素。\n美聯儲是否加息的決定。甚至在他們\n的決定，$BB仍然持有非常好。今天大部分時間都是紅色的~1%。\n而一旦他們發佈不加息，我們...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mmfchk","excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/asksb1h3bur61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e7f66575343d689cbd2dcd1c16184d912a27657","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmfchk/still_here_with_110_gme_shares_after_roding/","title":"Still here with 110 GME shares after roding through all the Tsunamis, Mavericks, Roller Coaster.","date":"April 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"津波、マーベリック、ジェットコースターの全てを乗り越えた後、GMEを110株保有しています。","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/asksb1h3bur61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e7f66575343d689cbd2dcd1c16184d912a27657","locale":"ja"},{"title":"把海啸、小牛、过山车都杆过之后，还在这里拿着110只金美股份。","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/asksb1h3bur61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e7f66575343d689cbd2dcd1c16184d912a27657","locale":"zh"},{"title":"把海嘯、小牛、過山車都杆過之後，還在這裏拿着110只金美股份。","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/asksb1h3bur61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e7f66575343d689cbd2dcd1c16184d912a27657","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mmqn1m","excerpt":"I like to keep a track of this for myself, but I'm sure there are others who are\ninterested in how things have shaken up, so below you'll find the changes.
