Other stocks I wanted and had were SAVE, LUV, CCL, DAL, IMAX.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the point I have is that I listened to people too much and I overthought stocks. I may have sold stocks on emotions too. I also never expected for stocks to rise so high so fast. Yes, I still made money but nowhere near as much as I could have. I had multiple opportunities and I didn&#39;t take them.
