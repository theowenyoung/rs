We are supposed to be a sub that talks about stocks. Why can&#39;t we just sticky a post that states that stocks go down as well as up and that a red day doesn&#39;t mean anything and be done with it?\nHalf the subs in this post aren&#39;t even about a stock anymore. Between that and the constant pump and dumps from WSBs we aren&#39;t a fraction of the sub we was before covid.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone else feel this way? Or do you enjoy the daily reassurance posts for when a stock you own goes down one percent after going up 200 percent this year?</p>\n\n<p>Worst part is that the posts reassuring people are always based of nothing from bag holders from pump and dump posts. BB is up an obscene amount. No it&#39;s not going back up to 25 dollars anytime soon.</p>\n\n<p>Pump and dumps have left us with tons of bag holders and now they all constantly make posts to help themselves and others hold the bags based on zero evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Can&#39;t wait for all the triggered BB holders but it&#39;s just an example of a Wsb pump and dumped that&#39;s screwed half the sub over that now gets a daily cry post</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mgasb3/do_we_still_talk_about_stocks_here/","title":"Do we still talk about stocks here?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-30T10:30:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-30 10:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mgasb3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mgasb3/do_we_still_talk_about_stocks_here/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mgasb3/do_we_still_talk_about_stocks_here/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"markhalliday8","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/markhalliday8","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"markhalliday8","score":160,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我们还在这里谈股票吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我不相信这个子变得这么软。老实说，市场下跌\n0.001%，子上涌现了很多让人放心的帖子，阻止某个人的\n亏本卖出，损失了1毛钱。\n\n这是很尴尬的。我们应该是一个谈论股票的子。怎么会呢？\n我们就不能贴个帖子... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們還在這裏談股票嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我不相信這個子變得這麼軟。老實說，市場下跌\n0.001%，子上湧現了很多讓人放心的帖子，阻止某個人的\n虧本賣出，損失了1毛錢。\n\n這是很尷尬的。我們應該是一個談論股票的子。怎麼會呢？\n我們就不能貼個帖子... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mzon9c","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzon9c/mnmd_32_million_bought_yesterday/","title":"MNMD $3.2 million bought yesterday","date":"April 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"MNMD 320万ドルを昨日購入","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"MNMD 3.2百万美元昨天买入","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"MNMD 3.2百萬美元昨天買入","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mzy4qn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzy4qn/never_bet_against_the_doctor/","title":"Never bet against the doctor","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 27, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"医者に賭けてはいけない","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"永远不要与医生打赌","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"永遠不要與醫生打賭","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mgasb3","previousId":"RedditPost-mzon9c","nextId":"RedditPost-mzy4qn","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mgasb3/do_we_still_talk_about_stocks_here/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
