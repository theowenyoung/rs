That means the huge majority of smart money is still holding and doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s a reason to panic. When smart money panics, you have the covid crash.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, its important to understand why there is so much red recently. The main reason is the fear due to the rising 10 year old treasury yield. When we woke up this morning, it did spike in a scary way, but now its going back down sharply, we are fine: <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX?p=%5ETNX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX?p=^TNX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch</a></p>\n\n<p>Now, even if this stupid 10 year old treasury yield did not go down, most people would agree these fears are irrational. Check this quick interview: <a href=\"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/video/philadelphia-fed-harker-don-t-011809466.html\">https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/video/philadelphia-fed-harker-don-t-011809466.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Historically, the rates, they go down, not up. The fear of massive interest rates are irrational, and as i said earlier, its only ~7% of people who are pulling out of nasdaq, that&#39;s a small number of people who&#39;s irrationally fearful. Feds have been under their target of 2% for a LONG time, they aren&#39;t concerned about this.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Biden agreed to tighten the covid stimulus requirements. This is good news because it means its less likely to over heat the economy beyond control. And when that stimulus does get released, its hard to imagine it won&#39;t at least give a small boost to the markets.</p>\n\n<p>I also think we need to look at the bright side. Historically, most crash happens when the market overheat. Corrections like we are having right now help avoid a real full breakdown of the market, and they help buy cheaper dips.</p>\n\n<p>I also think there is a decent chance our buddy JPow props up the market today with his speech ;)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lxnzms/stop_panicking_its_going_to_be_ok/","title":"Stop panicking, its going to be ok","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-04T19:31:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-04 19:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lxnzms","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lxnzms/stop_panicking_its_going_to_be_ok/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lxnzms/stop_panicking_its_going_to_be_ok/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Floofyboy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Floofyboy","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Floofyboy","score":129,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"不要惊慌，一切都会好起来的","the_new_excerpt":"首先，你仔细想想，纳斯达克一个月只跌了7%。那\n意味着绝大部分聪明的资金还在持有，不认为\n有一个理由恐慌。当聪明的资金恐慌的时候，你就会有covid崩溃。\n\n其次，重要的是要明白为什么有这么多的红色... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不要驚慌，一切都會好起來的","the_new_excerpt":"首先，你仔細想想，納斯達克一個月只跌了7%。那\n意味着絕大部分聰明的資金還在持有，不認爲\n有一個理由恐慌。當聰明的資金恐慌的時候，你就會有covid崩潰。\n\n其次，重要的是要明白爲什麼有這麼多的紅色... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m8wrem","excerpt":"Just thought I'd post a reminder to anyone that might still be in Robinhood to\nget away.\n\nThey've denied my transfer of assets multiple times, they don't respond to\nrequests for help and when they do they have no issue ignoring your complaints\nand/or lying to you.\n\nLiterally had my assets stuck…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m8wrem/please_stay_away_from_robinhood/","title":"Please stay away from Robinhood","date":"March 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"请远离Robinhood","the_new_excerpt":"我只是想发帖提醒那些可能还在Robinhood里的人\n脱身。\n\n他们已经多次拒绝我转移资产，他们不回应\n请求帮助，当他们这样做，他们没有任何问题忽略你的投诉。\n和/或骗你。\n\n从字面上看，我的资产卡住了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"請遠離Robinhood","the_new_excerpt":"我只是想發帖提醒那些可能還在Robinhood裏的人\n脫身。\n\n他們已經多次拒絕我轉移資產，他們不迴應\n請求幫助，當他們這樣做，他們沒有任何問題忽略你的投訴。\n和/或騙你。\n\n從字面上看，我的資產卡住了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m8q4lz","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8q4lz/all_that_for_a_drop_of_blood_let_them_diamond/","title":"ALL THAT FOR A DROP OF BLOOD.... 🤌🏻let them diamond nuts 💎 🥜 hang this weekend, see ya apes monday. i like the stock","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 20, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"所有这些都是为了一滴血....。🤌🏻让他们的钻石坚果💎 🥜挂这个周末，看到你的猿星期一。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"所有這些都是爲了一滴血....。🤌🏻讓他們的鑽石堅果💎 🥜掛這個週末，看到你的猿星期一。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lxnzms","previousId":"RedditPost-m8wrem","nextId":"RedditPost-m8q4lz","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lxnzms/stop_panicking_its_going_to_be_ok/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
