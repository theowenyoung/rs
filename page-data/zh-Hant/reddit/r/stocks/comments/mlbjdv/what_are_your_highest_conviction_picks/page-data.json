So to start off my high conviction funds and trusts are Smithson investment trust, fundsmith equity, lindsel train global equity, Finsbury growth and income, Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s why I like these funds and why you should reasherch them\nSo with fundsmith equity it&#39;s ran by Terry Smith who&#39;s a legendary British Investor from 2003 to now he&#39;s averaged around 15% returns and what&#39;s even more impressive from 2003 to 2013 in the &quot;lost decade&quot; he averaged 14% return every year.\nHe also gets a say in the Smithson investment trust but he doesn&#39;t run it everyday and Terry also gets compared to warren buffet.\nWith the lindsell train global equity and Finsbury growth and income they are both ran buy another legendary investor named nick train. He is a expert in the UK markets both his funds are diversified with exposure to Japan UK and USA.\nFinally to Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust. So these trust are similar to arkk funds and their parent company who controls the fund baillie Gifford were also at one point before the pandemic the second largest shareholder of Tesla just behind Elon musk they have sold some of Their stake after the impressive run up. The main reason I hold these trusts is because of the private company exposure</p>\n\n<p>Some honourable mentions are visa Mastercard and Adobe and Microsoft. I like them but won&#39;t buy them because of their valuations</p>\n\n<p>So what are your highest conviction stocks and why ?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mlbjdv/what_are_your_highest_conviction_picks/","title":"What are your highest conviction picks","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-07T01:17:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-07 01:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mlbjdv","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mlbjdv/what_are_your_highest_conviction_picks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mlbjdv/what_are_your_highest_conviction_picks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"royalshah10","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/royalshah10","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"royalshah10","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"あなたの最も高い信念のあるピックは何ですか？","the_new_excerpt":"つまり、あなたが最も確信を持っている銘柄は何かということです。\n\nまず、私が最も確信している銘柄は、バークシャー・ハサウェイです。\nフェイスブック、アマゾン、グーグル、ユニリーバ これらの銘柄が好きな理由を簡単に説明します。\n\nバークシャー・ハサウェイが好きなのは、ウォーレン・バッフェとチャーリー・マンガーがいるからです。\nまた、これは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你的最高信念选择是什么","the_new_excerpt":"所以很简单，你信念最高的股票是什么？\n\n所以开始我信念最高的股票必须是伯克希尔哈撒韦。\nFacebook、亚马逊、谷歌和联合利华 简而言之，我喜欢这些的原因是什么？\n\n所以我喜欢伯克希尔哈撒韦是因为沃伦-巴菲特和查理-芒格，但是... ...\n这也是一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你的最高信念選擇是什麼","the_new_excerpt":"所以很簡單，你信念最高的股票是什麼？\n\n所以開始我信念最高的股票必須是伯克希爾哈撒韋。\nFacebook、亞馬遜、谷歌和聯合利華 簡而言之，我喜歡這些的原因是什麼？\n\n所以我喜歡伯克希爾哈撒韋是因爲沃倫-巴菲特和查理-芒格，但是... ...\n這也是一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n5z9bf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5z9bf/gme_billboards_confirmed/","title":"GME Billboards confirmed","date":"May 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GMEビルボード確定","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"GME广告牌已确认","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME廣告牌已確認","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1389918721129553925","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1389918721129553925","title":"New covid-19 cases in the US are now down 81% from their peak in January, lowest levels since last October. https://t.co/DxeZzLA7PC","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"May 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"米国におけるコビド19の新規感染者数は、1月のピーク時から81％減少し、昨年10月以来の低水準となった。https://t.co/DxeZzLA7PC","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国新的covid-19病例现在比1月份的峰值下降了81%，是去年10月以来的最低水平。https://t.co/DxeZzLA7PC","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國新的covid-19病例現在比1月份的峯值下降了81%，是去年10月以來的最低水平。https://t.co/DxeZzLA7PC","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mlbjdv","previousId":"RedditPost-n5z9bf","nextId":"TweetPost-1389918721129553925","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mlbjdv/what_are_your_highest_conviction_picks/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
