Despite Netflix (NFLX) sharply missing earnings expectations in terms of new paid subscribers, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ), while the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) remain near record levels. </p>\n\n<p>After a recent spike this week, the CBOE Volatility Index sank back to near 52-week lows, a sign that investor risk appetite is increasing. The VIX is known as the &quot;investor fear gauge,&quot; because it reflects investors&#39; best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “The S&amp;P 500 has reached new highs while volatility has sharply declined. Low volatility has outweighed low correlations among stocks, driving return dispersion back below the long-term average. As the U.S. moves beyond key macro events such as the 2020 election, the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, and peak economic activity, we expect three defining themes for markets will be tax reform, infrastructure, and pricing power.”</p>\n\n<p>While Netflix (NFLX) sharply missed estimates, this earnings season has largely blown consensus estimates out of the water, with more than 81% of companies that have reported so far beating earnings expectations, according to a study by FactSet. However, despite the largely positive earnings, many stocks (apart from today) have failed to react positively to the news. It seems as more positive economic data is released in terms of consumer spending and unemployment, it takes more and more impressive results to convince investors to pile into the stock. This suggests there is froth in the markets given the sky-high valuation of some companies. </p>\n\n<p>White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, “My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don’t think it’s just going to go back and say, ‘Okay, everything’s fine. Go right back.’ I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The White House announced more than 200 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine have been distributed in the US, greatly surpassing original estimates of 100 million doses delivered in the first 100 days of Biden’s presidency. On the back of this robust distribution, all states are beginning to open back up.</li>\n<li>Mortgage applications jumped 8.6% in the week ended April 16, marking the biggest jump since late January as mortgage rates pulled back following a surge, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). </li>\n<li>Ford Motor (F) is planning more downtime at five North American factories due to a global semiconductor shortage. </li>\n<li>During yesterday’s virtual event, Apple (AAPL) announced a new slate of products set to include the companies own chip. The offering includes a new iMac, a new iPad, and a new tracking-device called Airtags.</li>\n<li>Gisele Bündchen, supermodel and Tom Brady’s wife was announced as a special advisor for the CEO and board of directors in DraftKings. This is just the latest in a series of high-profile moves by DraftKings to establish itself as the premier sport-betting company. </li>\n<li>After gapping up after earnings, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) joined the ranks of healthcare companies worth $100 billion or more</li>\n<li>After a series of high profile accidents including small children, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission advised consumer to not buy the treadmill if there are small kids or pets at home.This could affect the company&#39;s product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector. In response, Peloton (PTON) called the statements “inaccurate and misleading” and refused calls to recall their treadmill.
