Realistically, an ETF should have continued growth over years - mabye 5-10% a year? I’ve been invested in some of the ARK ETFS for 2 months and seen 20% gains already. Is this an effect of this bull market or is Cathie Woods really that great? How light do you guys think this can continue? I’m reluctant to putting a large amount of money into ARK because in 10-20 years time I’m not so sure ARK will be the mammoth it is today - although I’m sure it will still be gaining. Are these ARK ETFs here to stay long term or do you think they will reach the end of their life within 10 years?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lhw8s4/how_long_can_ark_momentum_continue/","title":"How long can ARK momentum continue?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T01:38:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 01:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lhw8s4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhw8s4/how_long_can_ark_momentum_continue/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhw8s4/how_long_can_ark_momentum_continue/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"theepicone111","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theepicone111","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"theepicone111","score":122,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ARK的势头还能持续多久？","the_new_excerpt":"我知道这是一只主动管理的基金，但这些收益是闻所未闻的。\n现实中，ETF应该有持续多年的增长--可能是5-10%的增长。\n年？我投资了一些ARK ETFS 2个月，看到了20%的收益\n已经。这是本轮牛市的效应，还是凯西-伍兹... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARK的勢頭還能持續多久？","the_new_excerpt":"我知道這是一隻主動管理的基金，但這些收益是聞所未聞的。\n現實中，ETF應該有持續多年的增長--可能是5-10%的增長。\n年？我投資了一些ARK ETFS 2個月，看到了20%的收益\n已經。這是本輪牛市的效應，還是凱西-伍茲... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lsl3tq","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsl3tq/lets_do_this_for_alex_amc_and_gme_to_the_moon/","title":"Let's do this for Alex!
