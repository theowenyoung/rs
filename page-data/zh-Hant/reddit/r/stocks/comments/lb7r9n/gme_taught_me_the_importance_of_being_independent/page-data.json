I&#39;m talking index funds and ETFs, the boring but good stuff. Ended 2020 with a 34% return thanks to the raging bull market which made me pour even more money into it. I bought into the GME hype at $34 dollars but eventually dca&#39;d my way to a solid $64 average cost. I got caught up in the bullish GME echo chamber that <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/\">r/wallstreetbets</a> now is - I was just lucky to get in and out early compared to others.</p>\n\n<p>As WSB&#39;s member count went through the roof, more and more users commented price targets and abusing people into not selling. By going to these users&#39; history, a lot - and I mean A LOT - had comments from 2 days ago along the lines of &quot;where to buy stocks?&quot;. It just made the echo chamber even clearer. These people, who had no idea, were commenting advice and about the future of GME. I&#39;m a beginner too but I wouldn&#39;t even think of pretending like I have a clue. The quote “If shoe shine boys are giving stock tips, then it&#39;s time to get out of the market&quot; have always stuck with me, but I never put much credibility into it, until now.</p>\n\n<p>I eventually dca&#39;d my way out at an average cost of $206 after reading about the conspiracy theories about why the reported 53% short interest was false. Maybe it is false and maybe these hedge have pulled off a great move in suppressing this % without actually covering in order to mislead investors, but I would never bet on that. Took $3.1k profit which was cool, but this whole situation has made me realize the importance of being independent.</p>\n\n<p>It has motivated me to actually learn how to read a balance sheet, do my own due diligence and come to my own conclusions - not depend on others. Reddit, Seeking Alpha and Twitter are great resources to take inspiration from, but I&#39;ll never invest through someone else&#39;s thesis again even though it worked out this time. The only thing that separates me from the guy who bought at $400 is that I picked up on the information earlier. We were both &quot;promised&quot; $1000, which I always saw as ridiculous but hey, &quot;everyone is spamming it so it must be true&quot;. No, that echo chamber mentality is dangerous and a lot of people have lost a lot of money as a product of it. You never know who&#39;s on the other side spamming their thesis. Might be Warren Buffet or a guy who downloaded *insert controversial broker here* 2 days ago - I won&#39;t blindly follow their advice either way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lb7r9n/gme_taught_me_the_importance_of_being_independent/","title":"GME taught me the importance of being independent","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T00:39:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 00:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lb7r9n","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lb7r9n/gme_taught_me_the_importance_of_being_independent/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lb7r9n/gme_taught_me_the_importance_of_being_independent/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"WiLjjam","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/WiLjjam","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"WiLjjam","score":889,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME教会了我独立的重要性","the_new_excerpt":"2020年夏天，我18岁的时候就开始投资了。我说的是\n指数基金和ETF，枯燥无味却又是好东西。2020年年底，回报率34%。\n感谢汹涌的牛市，让我投入了更多的资金。I\n买进GME炒作34美元，但最终DCA'D我的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME教會了我獨立的重要性","the_new_excerpt":"2020年夏天，我18歲的時候就開始投資了。我說的是\n指數基金和ETF，枯燥無味卻又是好東西。2020年年底，回報率34%。\n感謝洶湧的牛市，讓我投入了更多的資金。I\n買進GME炒作34美元，但最終DCA'D我的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ljbho3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljbho3/no_tendies_for_valentines/","title":"No tendies for valentines","date":"February 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"没有tendies的情人节","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"沒有tendies的情人節","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ljbgib","excerpt":"I did my research to find an alternative to Robinhood in light of recent events\nand finally initiated the full transfer of my Robinhood account to Fidelity.\nTheir website and app seems very information dense and not as easy to use as\nRobinhood but I am willing to learn and am never going to get back…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljbgib/how_many_of_you_have_moved_out_of_robinhood_and/","title":"How many of you have moved out of Robinhood and how many of you plan to do so in recent future?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 14, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你们中有多少人已经搬出了罗宾汉，又有多少人计划在近期搬出？","the_new_excerpt":"鉴于最近发生的事件，我做了研究，以寻找一个替代罗宾汉的方法。\n并最终启动了我的Robinhood账户的全部转移到Fidelity。\n他们的网站和应用程序似乎信息非常密集，而且不容易使用。\n罗宾汉的身份，但我愿意学习，而且永远也回不去了... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們中有多少人已經搬出了羅賓漢，又有多少人計劃在近期搬出？","the_new_excerpt":"鑑於最近發生的事件，我做了研究，以尋找一個替代羅賓漢的方法。\n並最終啓動了我的Robinhood賬戶的全部轉移到Fidelity。\n他們的網站和應用程序似乎信息非常密集，而且不容易使用。\n羅賓漢的身份，但我願意學習，而且永遠也回不去了... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lb7r9n","previousId":"RedditPost-ljbho3","nextId":"RedditPost-ljbgib","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lb7r9n/gme_taught_me_the_importance_of_being_independent/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
