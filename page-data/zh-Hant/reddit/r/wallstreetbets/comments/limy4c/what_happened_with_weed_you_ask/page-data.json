It&#39;s pretty simple, we have 10x as many active users as before. Most of them, I take it, are newbies who suffer from <strong>Paper Portnoy Syndrome</strong>. Let me break it down, these <strong>Paper Portnoys</strong> either:</p>\n\n<p>A) Buy high and sell low to &quot;mitigate&quot; losses. Fuck these types might sell as soon as they see a 1-3% drop, literally locking in a loss instead of moving away from the screen and averaging down or holding</p>\n\n<p>B) Buy and sell upon seeing a 10-20% gain thinking to be the next wolves of wallstreet with the 500$-1k they made</p>\n\n<p>If this describes any of your tendencies, I hate to break it to you but WSB isnt for you. What was good about WSB pre-GME is we admired loss porn as much as gain porn. Fuck one of the best WSB movies of all time came out due to the bonafide retard <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/BearIncarnate/\">u/BearIncarnate</a> betting his 401k on FDs SPY puts when the market was rallying for 6 months.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of us here dont mind seeing our portfolios down 30-50% on some days. Hell personally I get a lot of comfort knowing my portfolio is deep in the red because itll probs only go up from there. Every loss I incurred on the market was because I paper handed bitched and sold for a loss. Every stock I ever lost on wouldve gave me a W had I fucking held. Diamond handing is an ancient art and a skill.</p>\n\n<p>I worked in a grocery store and realized apparently even expired cheese will increase in price if you hold it long enough instead of throwing it out.</p>\n\n<p>Disclosure: I&#39;m a retard and use darts to pick my stocks so then again, what do I know?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/limy4c/what_happened_with_weed_you_ask/","title":"What happened with weed you ask?","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-13T14:23:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-13 14:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"limy4c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/limy4c/what_happened_with_weed_you_ask/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/limy4c/what_happened_with_weed_you_ask/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"FloatNuker","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/FloatNuker","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"FloatNuker","score":2239,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你问大麻怎么了？","the_new_excerpt":"除非你过去48小时都在石头下面，否则你就会注意到杂草的情况了\n股票。很简单，我们的活跃用户是以前的10倍。大部分的\n他们，我把它，是新手 谁患纸波特诺伊综合症。让我\n细数一下，这些纸波特尼要么。\n\nA)高价买入...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你問大麻怎麼了？","the_new_excerpt":"除非你過去48小時都在石頭下面，否則你就會注意到雜草的情況了\n股票。很簡單，我們的活躍用戶是以前的10倍。大部分的\n他們，我把它，是新手 誰患紙波特諾伊綜合症。讓我\n細數一下，這些紙波特尼要麼。\n\nA)高價買入...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ltzaoi","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltzaoi/there_will_be_tendies/","title":"There Will Be Tendies","date":"February 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"将会有Tendies","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"將會有Tendies","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ltuu37","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltuu37/3m_lossgot_a_call_yesterday_to_say_that_a_margin/","title":"$3M loss....got a call yesterday to say that a margin call that wouldn't be due until next wednesday was escalated to needing to be taken care of by EOD yesterday...","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 28, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"300万亏损....，昨天接到一个电话，说是下周三才到期的保证金催缴，昨天升级为需要EOD处理......","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"300萬虧損....，昨天接到一個電話，說是下週三才到期的保證金催繳，昨天升級爲需要EOD處理......","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-limy4c","previousId":"RedditPost-ltzaoi","nextId":"RedditPost-ltuu37","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/limy4c/what_happened_with_weed_you_ask/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
