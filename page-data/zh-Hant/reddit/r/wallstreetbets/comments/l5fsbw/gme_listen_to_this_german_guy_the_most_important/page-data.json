And was asked to post this as a discussion.</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing is actually <strong>until Friday there</strong> will be another <strong>price</strong> battle in which the short sellers will try to keep as many calls as possible outside the price so that they cannot be executed and the broker does not have to buy them on the market to cover them .<br/>\nIt is particularly critical because <strong>monthly and weekly calls</strong> expire, as far as I know the highest monthly call was <strong>60c 1/29</strong> and <strong>115c 1/29</strong> (left out the new 200c).</p>\n\n<p>The MM will try everything to push the course <strong>below 60</strong> , <strong>our goal to get to 115</strong> . Until then, <strong>expect massive short attacks</strong> , it will probably be even more blatant than yesterday. Since a price limit is harder to keep higher up, don&#39;t be surprised if there is a red tag up until then or the lower limit is 60-80.<br/>\nFor those of you who don&#39;t know what is meant, 100xLimit orders at $ 60 are $ 6000 &lt;$ 11500 100x at $ 115 and easier to hold or buy from autistic people.</p>\n\n<p>And almost most importantly <strong>, put your stop loss out</strong> , the <strong>shortsellers try</strong> to trigger as many as possible with their short sales in order to trigger <strong>a chain reaction of panic selling</strong> .</p>\n\n<p>Remember <strong>yesterday we saw exactly that</strong> , price dumping at its finest, although almost no short position was powered.</p>\n\n<p>Should we be <strong>able to hold the $ 115 by Friday</strong> , the banks (! Not the shortsellers) would have to buy an additional 8 million shares to cover the demand for the calls. To achieve this there is really only the possibility 🚀✋🏻💎🤚🏻,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Don&#39;t be a paper bitch!</strong></p>\n\n<p>All figures relate to estimates and information or assumptions and observations from DD from here and the Angelsachen forum.
