I cannot divulge my name, but ask me anything else and I will try to prove I&#39;m not bullshitting.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, today we saw Bloomberg, CNBC, and Reuters simultaneously blast glowing articles about how Plotkin made 20% in Feb. Every story came out at the same time and cited &quot;sources&quot; or &quot;people familiar with the matter,&quot; but barely had any other details. This is typical of story planted by PR.</p>\n\n<p>PRs will tell every reporter on the street &quot;hey I got a tip for you but don&#39;t publish until Wednesday after market.&quot; And every reporter thinks they have an exclusive and types up the article. And then PR gets the most bang for the buck as every outlet publishes the same bullshit at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>I would know. I deal with Melvin&#39;s cunty COO David Kurd when I was reporting on them. This is his usual tactic.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re lying about these gains. Probably not. Maybe they fudged some mark-to-market valuations to show a good month. But the bigger takeaways is that Melvin is desperate to improve their image. They are weak. We are strong.
