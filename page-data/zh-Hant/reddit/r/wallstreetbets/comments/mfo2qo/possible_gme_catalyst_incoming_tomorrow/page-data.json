This was officially announced at the Third Bridge interview on 21st of October 2020. The relevant tickers for this event were Microsoft (Obviously because of the deal), Sony and Nintendo (For the upcoming console news).</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot from the ol&#39; Bloomie Termie showing this event:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/aj99lxt4jyp61.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf98afcdbda9cb76aa86a30c0c46d2c736e2d16f\">The event that lead to the Microsoft catalyst (21 October 2020)</a></p>\n\n<h1>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h1>\n\n<h1>Now I present to you a possible Catalyst: the Iron to the Nitrogen and Hydrogen</h1>\n\n<p>On the 30th of March 2021 <em>(20:00 London/ 15:00 New York/ 03:00 Shanghai)</em> GameStop will be having another interview with Third Bridge and it has been named &quot;GameStop - E-commerce Transformation &amp; Structural Business Overview.&quot; This may be the reason why the leadership kept quiet about their future in the earnings call last week. They may have been holding out on any announcements so that Third Bridge could get the juicy news. But then again these are speculations coming from an A-Grade dumbass. So October was about the Microsoft deal and the upcoming console cycle. What do we have coming tomorrow? Take a look at the agenda on the image below:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nr2p6gsajyp61.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc09b1a7391b012e51f90239906f689800e18997\">Look at the agenda above. Notice the relevant tickers.</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The agenda above is exclusively linked to GameStop just as it was in the first image for the October interview. I say this because you may see Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy are listed as the relevant tickers for this interview. This is not about them. This involves them but the interview is about GameStop&#39;s future. Could those four companies be mentioned tomorrow in a huge deal that will spearhead the transformation of GameStop? I think so.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As a corporate move last week&#39;s earnings call seemed to be like a massive dud of a catalyst. This is strategic in my opinion. If I knew that our earnings would not meet expectations why would I mention my huge Ace in my hand? I would not risk the negative image of the below-expectations earnings tainting my major announcement for the future. Again this could also be about PS5 restock news and this is not a catalyst.</p>\n\n<h1>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h1>\n\n<h1>TL;DR</h1>\n\n<p>**Possible catalyst = GameStop has an interview tomorrow discussing their future with the same firm that they had an interview with when they announced the Microsoft deal in October 2020. Tomorrow&#39;s announcement also includes $AMZN, $WMT and $BBY as linked tickers to tomorrow&#39;s announcement.**</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><em>any arguments or clarifications are welcome</em></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit 1: Relevant tickers are likely due to those companies being direct GameStop competitors <a href=\"https://www.similarstores.com/like/GameStop\">https://www.similarstores.com/like/GameStop</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Removed rockets because people think that I am predicting a squeeze. This is purely an informative piece and is by no means a shot in the dark to predict the MOASS.
