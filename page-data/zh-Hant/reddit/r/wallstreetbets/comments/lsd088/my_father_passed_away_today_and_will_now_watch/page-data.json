Nobody really thinks about all the good things until someone is gone. My father wasn&#39;t a man of means, but during the early stages of my childhood fought hard to provide us an amazing life. And did so without ever really letting us know. </p>\n\n<p>After a divorce front my cheating bitch of a mother, after multiple back issues, multiple surgeries, and multiple risks to his day to day life, I think he just went downhill. </p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t gotten an official answer from the coroner since he&#39;s over 3 states away and it&#39;s all being communicated mostly through texts with his girlfriend right now, but honestly I&#39;m not sure I want to. </p>\n\n<p>I came here to say, my father believed in me with all of his being. When I told him I owned 4 shares of  GameStop and that it was way over priced when I bought it, he just told me how proud he was. Pretty convinced he didn&#39;t even know what I was saying. But in that same way he believed in me, he believed in every single one of you too. My father would&#39;ve loved this cause and would&#39;ve rallied with us till the end.</p>\n\n<p>I had a cool ass dad and you guys all deserve to have a cool ass dad too. He believed in me, and he believed in you too. Whether you&#39;re winners, or losers, or damn dirty apes. </p>\n\n<p>We love you dad. Thank you for believing in us.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsd088/my_father_passed_away_today_and_will_now_watch/","title":"My father passed away today, and will now watch over all of us apes to ensure we go the moon.
