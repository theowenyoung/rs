No mention of Cathie Woods accumulating shares, no mention of demo day on the horizon. No mention of the float structure and Mithril potentially buying the locked up shares. </p>\n\n<p>Seriously, who writes this stuff? It&#39;s almost like the chief editors of every financial publication agency are telling people to only write about WSB. This is really weird and it gives me the heebie jeebies. How can someone claiming to be a professional financial publication simply omits so many key facts about PLTR? Stuff seems borderline criminal. Anyone reading their article to get investment advice or info on PLTR got literally nothing. All they get is go check out <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a>.
