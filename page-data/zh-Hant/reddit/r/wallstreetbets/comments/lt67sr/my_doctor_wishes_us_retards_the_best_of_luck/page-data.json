But I&#39;m also buying dips on AMC at the same time and as a result, almost missed my name being called multiple times by the receptionist when my turn was ready. Tunnel vision is real.</p>\n\n<p>I get the swab and chat with the doc for a minute or two about all the Covid craziness and just overall life shit. He&#39;s a cool guy, super laid back and what not, and after a bit he steps out to go find my results. I&#39;m chillin in the exam room, waiting for my results and of course, I&#39;m still on my apps, just habitually watching the price and debating if I should go in on some more or not. About five or six minutes go by when my doctor returns with results. I didn&#39;t realize he could see the basic idea of what I was doing on my phone (price-watching etc) and as he passes me, I hear him say, &quot;Niiiiiice.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Being in the exam room and awaiting my results, I chime in with, &quot;Oh sweet, I&#39;m negative?&quot; He responds with, &quot;Nah, I saw the stonks on your phone. Good luck, retard.&quot; There&#39;s a pause in the air before he mentions Reddit and WSB, just to laugh off a potential HR issue calling a patient a retard, Turns out he&#39;s here somewhere in the 9 million strong pulling for us and has been holding strong and buying the dips too.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, TL;DR: My doctor said &quot;good luck, retard&quot; while catching me buying dips on AMC and he&#39;s here somewhere in the WSB crowd.</p>\n\n<p>Diamond hands, Covid neg, TO THE MOON WE GO!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt67sr/my_doctor_wishes_us_retards_the_best_of_luck/","title":"My doctor wishes us retards the best of luck","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-27T01:53:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-27 01:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lt67sr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt67sr/my_doctor_wishes_us_retards_the_best_of_luck/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt67sr/my_doctor_wishes_us_retards_the_best_of_luck/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"omgwowloljkstfu","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/omgwowloljkstfu","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"omgwowloljkstfu","score":15046,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我的医生祝愿我们这些弱智的人一切顺利","the_new_excerpt":"这个帖子可能会被埋没，但不管怎样，它很有趣。\n\n今天下午我去做了Covid的测试，被曝光后，什么都没有\n特别。但我同时也在AMC上买进跌停板，结果。\n差点错过了我的名字被前台叫了很多次，当我的。\n转...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的醫生祝願我們這些弱智的人一切順利","the_new_excerpt":"這個帖子可能會被埋沒，但不管怎樣，它很有趣。\n\n今天下午我去做了Covid的測試，被曝光後，什麼都沒有\n特別。但我同時也在AMC上買進跌停板，結果。\n差點錯過了我的名字被前臺叫了很多次，當我的。\n轉...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m3te37","excerpt":"I was mostly convinced about the media manipulation.
