Bottom line: if you have a <strong>MARGIN</strong> account with level 3 or 4 options approval, <strong>THEY ARE LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>However, you can request that they <strong>DO NOT</strong> lend <em>specific shares</em>, or even <em>all of your shares</em>. You just have to call them. It will go through a 3-5 day adjudication process, and they will either approve it 1) with no changes to your options approvals, or 2) approve it and lower your option level.</p>\n\n<p>Retirement accounts: mine are at level 2 options approval, and the rep told me my shares are <strong>NOT</strong> being lent out to shorts due to these being IRAs and the level 2 options approval I currently have.</p>\n\n<p>Non-qual accounts: if you have level 3/4, they may downgrade your account to level 2 if you request your shares to be &quot;un-shortable.&quot; This ultimately comes down to the adjudication process.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this is helpful to someone holding shares, and I hope it hurts those cocksucker hedge funds.</p>\n\n<p>Not financial advice / I like the stock / GME &amp; AMC to the 🌖🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Fidelity customer service 800-343-3548.

Major military battles have been won by attacking the enemy&#39;s supply lines. You&#39;re either part of the solution or part of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: I&#39;ll hold your hand all the way.... click the tab Accounts &amp; Trade &gt; Account Features &gt; Brokerage &amp; Trading &gt; Options. That will show you your options levels. Tighten the grip! 🐍</p>\n\n<p>Edit 4: hard to quantify, but if <strong>ALL OF YOU</strong> call your brokerage and cut off the lending of shares it will have a major positive affect on the GME share price.... let&#39;s call it a &quot;synthetic&quot; buy order to take shares out of circulation and tighten the squeeze.
