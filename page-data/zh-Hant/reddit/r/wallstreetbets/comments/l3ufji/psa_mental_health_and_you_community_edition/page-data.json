I haven’t seen anything like it.</p>\n\n<p>Last week was exhausting (and I was mainly just watching...)</p>\n\n<p>No doubt people are drained from stress, flying, falling, fear, ecstasy. This is especially true if you’ve partaken in drugs, alcohol, sex. No judgement, I just want you to do your laundry after the ecstasy to prepare for whatever is to come. Blood or angels. </p>\n\n<p>Many no doubt have wins and losses, and there is a huge amount of depletion that occurs inside of the brain and body after serious events. People need to refuel. It will help sharpen you for the coming week. </p>\n\n<p>Tips: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Go for a walk/stroll outside. Smell anything out there. </p></li>\n<li><p>Eat a balanced diet today. Load up on veggies and fruits. Drink a lot of water. A lot.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make dinner with your family. </p></li>\n<li><p>Crack jokes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Take a cold shower (“Wim Hof method”).</p></li>\n<li><p>Express and feel gratitude, starting with basic things like the fact you have eyes and can see. Try for 3 things, even if you are down. </p></li>\n<li><p>Search your maps for a float therapy (“isolation tank”, “floating”, “sensory deprivation”). This usually costs $70 and is a pinnacle experience. Trust me. I’ve been floating for years and you bet your ass I went today.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you can’t do the above, meditate.</p></li>\n<li><p>Read a book</p></li>\n<li><p>Draw</p></li>\n<li><p>Pray <a href=\"/u/SweetEmbraceableYou\">u/SweetEmbraceableYou</a></p></li>\n<li><p>If you have trouble sleeping: Chamomile tea, and Valerian Root or Melatonin <a href=\"/u/2ticketstotendytown\">u/2ticketstotendytown</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Yoga <a href=\"/u/Goin_off\">u/Goin_off</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Wear comfy socks.

It has no boundaries. You need to have a fresh mind and body to take on the volatility and pure Gs of a rocket ship. It is abso-fucking-lutely terrifying for some people. Whatever plays you’re making, please go into the coming week with a clear mind. I especially recommend floating in a sensory deprivation tank. </p>\n\n<p>Share your ideas in the comments, and when inspired, go do that thing. Please. For yourself. 👊</p>\n\n<p>God speed, retards 🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ufji/psa_mental_health_and_you_community_edition/","title":"PSA: Mental Health and YOU (Community edition)","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T17:20:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 17:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l3ufji","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ufji/psa_mental_health_and_you_community_edition/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ufji/psa_mental_health_and_you_community_edition/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Macnamera","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Macnamera","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Macnamera","score":1646,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"公益广告：心理健康与你(社区版)","the_new_excerpt":"我希望这个帖子是合适的。我还没有见过这样的事情。\n\n上周真是累死人了（我主要就是看......）。\n\n毫无疑问，人们因为压力、飞翔、坠落、恐惧、狂喜而疲惫不堪。这就是\n尤其是当你参与了毒品，酒精，性行为的时候。没有判断，我只是\n要你...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"公益廣告：心理健康與你(社區版)","the_new_excerpt":"我希望這個帖子是合適的。我還沒有見過這樣的事情。\n\n上週真是累死人了（我主要就是看......）。\n\n毫無疑問，人們因爲壓力、飛翔、墜落、恐懼、狂喜而疲憊不堪。這就是\n尤其是當你參與了毒品，酒精，性行爲的時候。沒有判斷，我只是\n要你...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lbp5nr","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbp5nr/i_wanted_to_participate_in_this_money_isnt_my/","title":"I wanted to participate in this (money isnt my goal, i'm good when it comes to that) so I got me a little 3400 shares at 100$ unit price🙌🏼💎 Ill be sharing profit and loss \"porn\" as you guys call it & I'm eager to know y'all and I hope you have room for a European wsb intern 🙏🏻","date":"February 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我想参与这个（钱不是我的目标，我很好，当它涉及到这一点），所以我得到了我一个小3400股100美元的单价🙌🏼💎 我会分享利润和损失 \"色情\"，因为你们叫它&我渴望知道你们，我希望你有一个欧洲wsb实习生🙏🏻","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我想參與這個（錢不是我的目標，我很好，當它涉及到這一點），所以我得到了我一個小3400股100美元的單價🙌🏼💎 我會分享利潤和損失 \"色情\"，因爲你們叫它&我渴望知道你們，我希望你有一個歐洲wsb實習生🙏🏻","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lcc7k7","excerpt":"Hi,\n\nAs some of you already know Tilray and Aphria are going to merge in Q2, with\nTilray becoming the surviving Company.\n\nNow the fun thing about it:\n\nAphria stockholders are to obtain 0.8381 of one share of Tilray for each Aphria\nshare they own.\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/16/tilray-and…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcc7k7/tilray_inc_and_aphria_inc_observation_mathematics/","title":"Tilray Inc. and Aphria Inc observation + mathematics","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 04, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Tilray Inc.和Aphria Inc.观察+数学。","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，我的天\n\n有些人已经知道，Tilray和Aphria将在第二季度合并，并与\nTilray成为幸存的公司。\n\n现在是有趣的事情了。\n\nAphria公司的股东每持有一股Aphria公司的股票 就可以获得0. 8381股Tilray公司的股票。\n自己的股份。\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/16/tilray-and...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Tilray Inc.和Aphria Inc.觀察+數學。","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，我的天\n\n有些人已經知道，Tilray和Aphria將在第二季度合併，並與\nTilray成爲倖存的公司。\n\n現在是有趣的事情了。\n\nAphria公司的股東每持有一股Aphria公司的股票 就可以獲得0. 8381股Tilray公司的股票。\n自己的股份。\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/16/tilray-and...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l3ufji","previousId":"RedditPost-lbp5nr","nextId":"RedditPost-lcc7k7","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ufji/psa_mental_health_and_you_community_edition/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
