Right now it&#39;s a fight between puts and calls at strike 60 to stay in the money. <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp\">Max Pain Theory</a> says the longs and shorts will fight over their strikes with the highest volume as expiration approaches, ultimately making the the maximum number of calls expire OTM.</p>\n\n<p>But there are 89,000 call options expiring friday from $60-$120 that MMs will have to hedge as the price increase. Shorts are going to do anything they can to keep it down below that to save themselves.</p>\n\n<p>There are another 60,000 puts that are expiring today that market makers will have to unhedge as the price rises, also contributing to a gamma squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>There are another 90k calls from $120 to $800 that are almost completely unhedged, but I&#39;m also not expecting us to pump all the way up to the 800s to squeeze those so i&#39;ve excluded them from the main numbers.</p>\n\n<p>These are personal opinions/my guesses and not investment advice. I&#39;ve also got so much GME that I can&#39;t do anything but stare at this stupid chart all day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> In total that&#39;s 15,000,000 million shares they&#39;d have to buy today of which they&#39;ve only hedged about 3 million so far (rough estimate based on eyeballing the delta). That&#39;s a whole lot of squeeze if we can find the juice. \n*Edit for the requested rocket ships 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldee1f/gme_gamma_squeeze_7_million_shares_left_to_hedge/","title":"GME Gamma Squeeze, 7+ million shares left to hedge 🚀🚀","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-06T01:19:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-06 01:19","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ldee1f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldee1f/gme_gamma_squeeze_7_million_shares_left_to_hedge/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldee1f/gme_gamma_squeeze_7_million_shares_left_to_hedge/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/nS9BH6s-nGdLYfoUx7FSoPKZ36H7NaenuDC4AJRQ4Es.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6c73669ae1a9419f09dcd1f4f4e5702a6d2c600f","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"OhNoWasabiAhead","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/OhNoWasabiAhead","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"OhNoWasabiAhead","score":16044,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME Gamma Squeeze，还剩700多万股被套牢🚀🚀。","the_new_excerpt":"https://i.redd.it/kukifiwqgpf61.png\n\n这可能是导致我们早期飙升至95美元的原因，在空头恐慌之前。\n现在是看跌和看涨之间的斗争，在行使60的时候，要保持在资金中。\n最大痛苦理论[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp]说\n多头和空头会打架... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME Gamma Squeeze，還剩700多萬股被套牢🚀🚀。","the_new_excerpt":"https://i.redd.it/kukifiwqgpf61.png\n\n這可能是導致我們早期飆升至95美元的原因，在空頭恐慌之前。\n現在是看跌和看漲之間的鬥爭，在行使60的時候，要保持在資金中。\n最大痛苦理論[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp]說\n多頭和空頭會打架... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1362524277552070662","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1362524277552070662","title":"Copper is now at its highest level in 9 years, doubling from its low last March. $COPPER https://t.co/1RGtdmtoYI","date":"February 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"铜目前处于9年来的最高水平，较去年3月的低点翻了一番。$COPPER https://t.co/1RGtdmtoYI","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"銅目前處於9年來的最高水平，較去年3月的低點翻了一番。$COPPER https://t.co/1RGtdmtoYI","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ln5iae","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ln5iae/cnbc_is_really_not_holding_back_i_see/","title":"CNBC is really not holding back I see","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 19, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我看CNBC是真的不忍心","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我看CNBC是真的不忍心","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ldee1f","previousId":"TweetPost-1362524277552070662","nextId":"RedditPost-ln5iae","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldee1f/gme_gamma_squeeze_7_million_shares_left_to_hedge/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
