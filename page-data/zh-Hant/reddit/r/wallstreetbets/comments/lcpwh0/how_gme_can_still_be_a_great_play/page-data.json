I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I&#39;ve used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company&#39;s stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time,</p>\n\n<p>Power to the players,</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Precocious_Kid\">u/Precocious_Kid</a> brought up a point: We should ask for a reverse stock split. &quot;In the event that the reverse stock split happens, Citadel and the phantom shares creators will be stuck holding all of their losses on those short positions!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/","title":"How $GME can still be a great play","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T01:24:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 01:24","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcpwh0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/NglHIJwusRJQ6ELuQ-ctf9Zit0lKUFSA-T_qqjFzFgQ.jpg?width=216&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=682450801d5b7e1c44f7db95bc72630e6f034ce8","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"gnadami","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/gnadami","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"gnadami","score":20944,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$GME如何仍能成为一出好戏？","the_new_excerpt":"对于所有还想去月球的自闭症患者，我这里有票。\n\n+1(817) 424-2001\n\n这是GameStop官方专用的投资者关系号码。任何GME\n股民可以打这个电话，答录机会接你的电话。去吧，去吧\n记录你的全名，股数... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$GME如何仍能成爲一出好戲？","the_new_excerpt":"對於所有還想去月球的自閉症患者，我這裏有票。\n\n+1(817) 424-2001\n\n這是GameStop官方專用的投資者關係號碼。任何GME\n股民可以打這個電話，答錄機會接你的電話。去吧，去吧\n記錄你的全名，股數... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-llykgt","excerpt":"Things are pretty red today, and a lot of new investors are freaking out right\nnow, so I think it's worth explaining that this is totally normal.\n\nStocks never rocket straight to the moon -- they bump up and down on the way.\nAnd, when you have a red day like today, there are ways to predict when…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/llykgt/why_you_shouldnt_panic_about_todays_dip/","title":"Why you shouldn't panic about today's dip","date":"February 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么你不应该对今天的跌势感到恐慌？","the_new_excerpt":"今天的事情很红，很多新的投资者都吓坏了吧。\n现在，所以我认为值得解释的是，这是完全正常的。\n\n股票从来没有火箭直达月球 -- 他们在途中上下颠簸。\n而且，当你有一个红色的一天，像今天， 有办法预测当... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼你不應該對今天的跌勢感到恐慌？","the_new_excerpt":"今天的事情很紅，很多新的投資者都嚇壞了吧。\n現在，所以我認爲值得解釋的是，這是完全正常的。\n\n股票從來沒有火箭直達月球 -- 他們在途中上下顛簸。\n而且，當你有一個紅色的一天，像今天， 有辦法預測當... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-llut6h","excerpt":"This is an amazing article:\nhttps://www.personalfinanceclub.com/how-to-perfectly-time-the-market/ please\ncheck it.\n\nThe summary is:\n\n 1.
