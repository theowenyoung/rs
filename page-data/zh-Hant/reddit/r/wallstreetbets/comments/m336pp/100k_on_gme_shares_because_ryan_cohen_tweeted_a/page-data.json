However I believe there are a number of catalysts leading up to earnings. </p>\n\n<p>1) Cohen as ceo \nSherman&#39;s been ceo for exactly 2 years now. Since Cohen has joined the board other Chewy folks have been hired into senior roles. Cohen is in charge of a committee that is hiring the next CFO and is responsible for capital allocation. Sherman is not on that committee. Sherman tanked the last earnings call and stock price while cohen rescued it by buying a meme level of shares. </p>\n\n<p>Cohen has made Sherman so much money (sherman has 2m shares that he can&#39;t sell easily as an insider). It&#39;s in sherman&#39;s best interests to get out and get liquid on what could be a billion dollar nest egg.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 Sherman was announced as CEO 5 days BEFORE earnings. </p>\n\n<p>2) Debt \nGMEs 2021 bond matures in 4 days. Potential credit rating impact. </p>\n\n<p>3) Potential 3/19 DTCC changes forcing brokers to force close short positions or at least shore up capital (could negatively impact longs as well, unsure here though)</p>\n\n<p>4) IV will likely spike in calls just before earnings</p>\n\n<p>5) cohen&#39;s tweeting </p>\n\n<p>All of this, while a squeeze is actively happening was enough to yolo some shares after hours and some calls tomorrow if we see a dip.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m336pp/100k_on_gme_shares_because_ryan_cohen_tweeted_a/","title":"$100K on GME shares because Ryan Cohen tweeted a GIF of someone shitting","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-12T15:49:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-12 15:49","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m336pp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m336pp/100k_on_gme_shares_because_ryan_cohen_tweeted_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m336pp/100k_on_gme_shares_because_ryan_cohen_tweeted_a/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/MNc8bgyjvn-xCxfeRR2CTYjJHK0E6rB3eRlk93Xa14M.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9e5578e25f9d860258585d623d16b96dc6b93d39","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"FatAspirations","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/FatAspirations","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"FatAspirations","score":7096,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"10万美元买入GME股票，因为Ryan Cohen在推特上发了一张有人拉屎的GIF图片。","the_new_excerpt":"我在GME上的DD都是那么的平淡，但在这个问题上却要YOLO。\n盈利即将到来，潜在的CEO宣布，太多的催化剂。\n我把我在GME的部分收益从挤压1，并把它回来... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"10萬美元買入GME股票，因爲Ryan Cohen在推特上發了一張有人拉屎的GIF圖片。","the_new_excerpt":"我在GME上的DD都是那麼的平淡，但在這個問題上卻要YOLO。\n盈利即將到來，潛在的CEO宣佈，太多的催化劑。\n我把我在GME的部分收益從擠壓1，並把它回來... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mg5nij","excerpt":"BABA?
