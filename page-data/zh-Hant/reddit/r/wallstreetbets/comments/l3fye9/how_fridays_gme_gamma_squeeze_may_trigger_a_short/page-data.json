It <strong>ripped face</strong> from $43 up to $75 in the morning session. That was fucking wild, even for this autist&#39;s dream of a stock. </p>\n\n<p>Others have already commented on why this has happened, but I&#39;ll summarize for the dunces in the back. In short, the market makers wrote a <strong>LOT</strong> of OTM calls last week, and then had to buy shares to cover when those calls went ITM around noon. This is what caused the absurd spike from $50 to $75 in just an hour and a half. That&#39;s the <strong>gamma squeeze</strong> that everyone has been talking about, where MM&#39;s couldn&#39;t cover fast enough.</p>\n\n<p>The rest is history, GME closed at $65, and every single call that expired yesterday was ITM. That&#39;s fucking retarded. </p>\n\n<p>What this means, though, is that the MM&#39;s/brokers are going to have to deliver a ridiculous amount of shares when these expired options settle. Typically, settlement is on Tuesdays. I&#39;ve read estimates that 10-15M shares worth of calls expires ITM last Friday. Again, this is fucking retarded. </p>\n\n<p>Please note that <strong>none</strong> of the above movement relates directly to the short squeeze... but it will. Because there are now 10-15M shares tied up in the clearing houses, there are now even <strong>fewer</strong> shares to be borrowed. There are estimates that the true short interest on this stock was around 300%. Now, with about 20% of the total float <strong>committed to the fucking clearing house</strong> as they sort out Friday&#39;s shitshow, I expect true short interest is closer to 500%. </p>\n\n<p>Demand for GME will continue to pump on Monday. This is a cultural event now, where every lay person can be a modern-day Robin Hood. The shorts are going to have their positions closed whether they like it or not if this continues (which it will). Since there are far <em>far</em> <strong>far</strong> fewer shares floating over the next 2 trading days, though, a squeeze on Monday or Tuesday could utterly destroy Melvin and the other shorts. </p>\n\n<p>If RC even opens his twitter app this weekend, it&#39;s over. </p>\n\n<p>Positions: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/7ipopDo\">Take what&#39;s yours, gents.</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3fye9/how_fridays_gme_gamma_squeeze_may_trigger_a_short/","title":"How Friday's GME gamma squeeze may trigger a short squeeze on Monday and Tuesday","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-23T21:03:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-23 21:03","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l3fye9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3fye9/how_fridays_gme_gamma_squeeze_may_trigger_a_short/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3fye9/how_fridays_gme_gamma_squeeze_may_trigger_a_short/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/o7izGaq0bcydSd1-wb9Tjh9pay2gx4NbSn9JVPkUIAc.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=afaa792fbb10e63e26fbd56d2382c4993c1b8e97","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"psytokine_storm","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/psytokine_storm","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"psytokine_storm","score":10048,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"周五GME伽马压制如何可能引发周一和周二的空头压制。","the_new_excerpt":"我不知道有没有人注意到，但周五对GME来说是个大日子。\n早盘从43元撕破脸，涨到75元。这真是太疯狂了\n甚至对于这个自闭症患者的股票梦。\n\n其他的已经评论了为什么会发生这种情况，但我将总结为\n这个笨蛋在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"週五GME伽馬壓制如何可能引發週一和週二的空頭壓制。","the_new_excerpt":"我不知道有沒有人注意到，但週五對GME來說是個大日子。\n早盤從43元撕破臉，漲到75元。這真是太瘋狂了\n甚至對於這個自閉症患者的股票夢。\n\n其他的已經評論了爲什麼會發生這種情況，但我將總結爲\n這個笨蛋在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lbwvw1","excerpt":"Roblox is going public this year so share holders can offer their shares to the\npublic.
