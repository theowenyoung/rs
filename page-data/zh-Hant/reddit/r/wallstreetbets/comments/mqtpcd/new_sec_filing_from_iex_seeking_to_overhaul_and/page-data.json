This will close several loopholes that market makers and HF have over retail investors for all trades routed to IEX.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf\">https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enhance the Exchange’s Retail Price Improvement Program for the <strong>benefit of retail investors.</strong> Specifically, the Exchange proposes to make the following four changes: (i) revise the definition of Retail order in IEX Rule 11.190(b)(15) to <strong>apply only to the trading interest of a natural person that does not place more than 390 equity orders per day</strong> on average during a calendar month for its own beneficial account(s);7 (ii) <strong>provide Order Book8 priority to Retail Liquidity Provider (“RLP”) orders9 at the Midpoint Price10 ahead of other non-displayed orders priced to execute at the Midpoint Price;</strong> (iii) disseminate a “Retail Liquidity Identifier” through the Exchange’s proprietary market data feeds and the appropriate securities information processor (“SIP”) when RLP order interest aggregated to form at least one round lot for a particular security is available in the System,11 provided that the RLP order interest is resting at the Midpoint Price and is <strong>priced at least $0.001 better than the NBB12 or NBO13</strong>; and (iv) amend the definition of RLP orders so <strong>such orders can only be midpoint peg orders</strong>,14 cannot be Discretionary Peg orders,15 and cannot include a minimum quantity restriction.16 The proposed changes are designed to further support and enhance the ability of non-professional retail investors to obtain meaningful price improvement by incentivizing market participants to compete to provide such price improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Retail Liquidity Provider means a broker that routes retail orders through the IEX. You can call your broker and see if they are an RLP for IEX.</p>\n\n<p>Read some of the DD to learn a bit on how <strong>non displayed orders</strong> are likely being used by citadel and friends to manipulate the price.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, it seems like a major step in the right direction to help level the playing field. It looks like it has to go through the traditional comment period before approval. (Not an advance notice).</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: This completely negates the ability for other firms to see retail orders before execution and then act accordingly to manipulate the price. This would give retail orders <strong>Priority over other non-displayed orders. It would also force the broker to enter the trade at the midpoint price (Ie between ask and bid). Previously, this could be manipulated to decrease the price by consistently filling orders at lower and lower prices so that even though people are buying, the price drops.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Still reading will add more as needed.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: moved some things around and added TL;DR</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqtpcd/new_sec_filing_from_iex_seeking_to_overhaul_and/","title":"New SEC filing from IEX seeking to overhaul and improve fairness in executing trades for retail investors.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"April 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-14T22:34:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-14 22:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mqtpcd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqtpcd/new_sec_filing_from_iex_seeking_to_overhaul_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqtpcd/new_sec_filing_from_iex_seeking_to_overhaul_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Scalpel_Jockey9965","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Scalpel_Jockey9965","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Scalpel_Jockey9965","score":2007,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"IEXは、個人投資家の取引執行における公平性の向上を求めて、SECに新たな申請を行いました。","the_new_excerpt":"未発表、明日投下予定。これにより、マーケットメーカーやHFが個人投資家に対して持っているいくつかの抜け道が解消される。\nマーケットメーカーやHFが個人投資家に対して持っているいくつかの抜け道がなくなります。\n抜け道を塞ぐことになります。\n\nhttps://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf\n\nこのルール変更案の目的は、当取引所の...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"IEX向美国证券交易委员会提交新的文件，寻求彻底改革并提高散户投资者执行交易的公平性。","the_new_excerpt":"未公布，计划明天投放。这将堵塞几个漏洞\n庄家和 \"高频 \"在所有交易中都优于散户。\nIEX.\n\nhttps://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf\n\n建议修改规则的目的是为了加强交易所的...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"IEX向美國證券交易委員會提交新的文件，尋求徹底改革並提高散戶投資者執行交易的公平性。","the_new_excerpt":"未公佈，計劃明天投放。這將堵塞幾個漏洞\n莊家和 \"高頻 \"在所有交易中都優於散戶。\nIEX.\n\nhttps://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf\n\n建議修改規則的目的是爲了加強交易所的...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mqvqjb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqvqjb/us_senate_votes_5345_to_confirm_gary_gensler_as/","title":"U.S. Senate votes 53-45 to confirm Gary Gensler as Biden's SEC chief","date":"April 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"米上院、53-45でゲイリー・ゲンスラー氏をバイデン氏のSEC長官に承認","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"美国参议院以53-45票确认加里-根斯勒为拜登的证监会主席。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國參議院以53-45票確認加里-根斯勒爲拜登的證監會主席。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mqzvok","excerpt":"PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 14, 2021\n\nStocks traded mixed on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones rallying to intraday highs\nwhile the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back.
