Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring earnings season, with many more notable companies reporting this week. </p>\n\n<p>Last week, the US reported great economic data that fuelled the current rally. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. </p>\n\n<p>After a very choppy first quarter to the year, volatility has subsided considerably in recent sessions. Despite a small spike today, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, remains near-14 month lows as equities continue higher. The VIX is known as the &quot;investor fear gauge,&quot; because it reflects investors&#39; best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. It is a way to gauge the risk appetite of market participants. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “The S&amp;P 500 has reached new highs while volatility has sharply declined. Low volatility has outweighed low correlations among stocks, driving return dispersion back below the long-term average. As the U.S. moves beyond key macro events such as the 2020 election, the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, and peak economic activity, we expect three defining themes for markets will be tax reform, infrastructure, and pricing power.</p>\n\n<p>Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause &quot;out of an abundance of caution,&quot; the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Notable earnings for tomorrow: Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), P&amp;G (PG), Abbott (ABT),  Netflix (NFLX), Interactive Brokers (IBKR), Silvergate (SI)</li>\n<li>Shares of Tesla (TSLA) slumped more than 6% before recovering throughout the day after reports that two people died after a driverless Tesla crashed in Texas</li>\n<li>The U.K. government said it would probe Nvidia Corp.&#39;s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp., over possible national security issues, adding new regulatory scrutiny to the proposed deal.</li>\n<li>China’s market regulator is investigating a joint venture between e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and Minmetals Development, amid a broad antitrust clampdown on internet firms in China.</li>\n<li>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning Saturday advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive&#39;s treadmill if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March during a treadmill accident. This could affect the company&#39;s product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector, according to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.
