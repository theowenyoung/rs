The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) set fresh intraday records while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) traded mostly flat. </p>\n\n<p>According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. </p>\n\n<p>This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP (<a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:%7E:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.\">more info here</a>) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank&#39;s monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. </p>\n\n<p>Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” </p>\n\n<p>Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause &quot;out of an abundance of caution,&quot; the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>General Motors (GM) and joint-venture partner LG Chem Ltd. plan to invest $2.3 billion to construct a second battery-cell plant as the automaker continues investing in electric vehicles.</li>\n<li>Morgan Stanley (MS) posted better-than-expected earnings but revealed the company lost $911 million when Archegos Capital Management, Bill Hwang’s family office, imploded last month.</li>\n<li>NIO is likely to make an official announcement concerning its European expansion plan on May 7 or 8 according to multiple reports. </li>\n<li>Daimler AG unveiled a new high-tech and luxury all-electric Mercedes called the EQS</li>\n<li>**<strong>Please note that current stock price was written in the morning and does not reflect intraday changes*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Applied Materials (AMAT) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $150 to $160 at Buy.
