He also promoted AMD a lot which many people love and are super long on...</p>\n\n<p>Anyways i was listening to Mad Money from Tuesday 3/23/2021 and it was very subtle but i noticed he mentioned that there will be a rotation back to tech stocks soon. Cramer mentioned around easter is when things rally. I am curious to see what happens </p>\n\n<p>In addition today and yesterday listening to Fast Money/ Squak i noticed they mentioned the same thing... but in a different way. They mentioned that PE&#39;s for &quot;value&quot; are slowly  reaching PE&#39;s of &quot;tech&quot; and that with that people are going to jump back into the tech stocks thinking they are getting a deal now which will effectively cause a rotation back to tech. </p>\n\n<p>I found this interesting because in the previous weeks they&#39;ve been promoting value value value and ive been waiting for the hint that we are rotating back. </p>\n\n<p>What are everyone thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mcm9w1/love_him_or_hate_him_cramer_cnbc_hinted_at_a/","title":"Love him or hate him...
