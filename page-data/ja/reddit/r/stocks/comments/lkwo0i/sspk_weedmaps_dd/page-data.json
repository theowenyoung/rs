They are essentially a data hub for dispensaries where people can either place an order for pickup or even delivery in legal areas. Dispensaries pay big money to be featured by WeedMaps. They are the leader for e-commerce &amp; advertising for the whole cannabis sector. </p>\n\n<p>The only hurdle for WeedMaps to jump through is regulations and legalization. Even Alabama is letting people smoke the ganja now.. plus Chuck Shumer (Senate majority leader) said it is a main focus of Congress to pass federal marijuana legalization laws. Seems to just be a matter of time now. WeedMaps is positioned to be one of the biggest beneficiaries from this. </p>\n\n<p>The app has almost 200k reviews and an average 4.9/5 star rating, obviously many people like the service. Essentially the Shopify of cannabis.. SSPK (WeedMaps) is an absolute steal in the 20’s. IMO this will be a “blue chip” cannabis stock along with GRWG in the long run. </p>\n\n<p>If this were an IPO as opposed to a Special acquisition company merger I’d expect it priced at 50+ like we saw with Bumble or Doordash. People will flock to this stock especially once the ticker changes. </p>\n\n<p>Financials🤓</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue forecast to grow at an annualized 40%, EBITDA at an annualized 55% through 2023</li>\n<li>WeedMaps generates 1.5 billion in gross merchandise volume alone</li>\n<li>Stock trades at enterprise value of 5.6x 2022 sales, well below SaaS comps. </li>\n<li>WeedMaps operates a high-margin marketplace services and never “touches the plant”</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lkwo0i/sspk_weedmaps_dd/","title":"SSPK- WeedMaps DD🍃🔥","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-16T15:28:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-16 15:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lkwo0i","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lkwo0i/sspk_weedmaps_dd/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lkwo0i/sspk_weedmaps_dd/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"waltertrading","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/waltertrading","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"waltertrading","score":67,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"SSPK- WeedMaps DD🔥","the_new_excerpt":"如果你是一个大麻行家，你知道WeedMaps。它们基本上是\n一个药房的数据中心，人们可以在这里下单取药，也可以在这里下单取药。\n甚至在合法区域内送货。药房花了大钱，以被\nWeedMaps。他们是电子商务和广告的领导者，为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"SSPK- WeedMaps DD🔥","the_new_excerpt":"如果你是一個大麻行家，你知道WeedMaps。它們基本上是\n一個藥房的數據中心，人們可以在這裏下單取藥，也可以在這裏下單取藥。\n甚至在合法區域內送貨。藥房花了大錢，以被\nWeedMaps。他們是電子商務和廣告的領導者，爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lvuk88","excerpt":"I've lurked here for a while, but never posted.
