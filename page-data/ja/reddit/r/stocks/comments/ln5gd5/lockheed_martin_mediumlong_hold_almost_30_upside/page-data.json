No significant news coming out of the defense department lately - which is overall a good thing for the world, imo. However, that leaves opportunity to make money on the stock when the news does come.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s some rudimentary TA: Notice the momentum (weekly) at the bottom, and my exit point. I expect another 1-4 months before hitting my exit. Obviously, the goal for investing is to buy low and sell high - this is that opportunity if you are prepared to hold in the medium term.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/OWao3tt\">https://imgur.com/a/OWao3tt</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I could write a long winded DD about Space Force, growing tensions with China and the issues the US has with their growing military, their acquisition of AeroJet RocketDyne (Raytheon is pissed and filed with the DOJ because of it), the Russian hacks, etc. However, I&#39;m lazy and I think the price targets, TA, logic, and life experience are good enough for me.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ln5gd5/lockheed_martin_mediumlong_hold_almost_30_upside/","title":"Lockheed Martin - Medium/Long Hold - Almost 30% upside","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-19T19:07:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-19 19:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ln5gd5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ln5gd5/lockheed_martin_mediumlong_hold_almost_30_upside/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ln5gd5/lockheed_martin_mediumlong_hold_almost_30_upside/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"StudentforaLifetime","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/StudentforaLifetime","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"StudentforaLifetime","score":45,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"洛克希德-马丁公司--中长线持有--近30%的上涨空间。","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在关注那些强势却走势缓慢的落后股。\n\n这是我几个月前在10月份的时候写的关于雷神的文章。它\n花了大约一个月的时间，但它确实达到了75美元的目标价格，并一直徘徊在\n从70-72美元的价格区间，自。有25%的收益，易。更多与...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"洛克希德-馬丁公司--中長線持有--近30%的上漲空間。","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在關注那些強勢卻走勢緩慢的落後股。\n\n這是我幾個月前在10月份的時候寫的關於雷神的文章。它\n花了大約一個月的時間，但它確實達到了75美元的目標價格，並一直徘徊在\n從70-72美元的價格區間，自。有25%的收益，易。更多與...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ly1mbx","excerpt":"After losing billions for multiple weeks to the retail investor and proclaiming\nthey are changing strategies to invest in growth stocks, hedge funds start a new\ngame.
