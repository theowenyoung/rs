I wanted to thank you all who post on this sub. I&#39;ve never posted here, but  I&#39;ve been following for about 6-7 months, and most of my picks came from the detailed posts I came across here. \nI started investing around this time last year as a recent unemployed college graduate (22 years old) putting in some of my Walmart paycheck every other week. Over the spring,I accepted a teaching job and have been able to increase my monthly contributions and have been loving the gains, although small in comparison to what I&#39;ve seen, that I&#39;ve been able to make.\nI know this was an extraordinary year, and I definitely shouldn&#39;t expect these kinds of returns yearly, but I&#39;m eager to see how my portfolio performs in the future!\nSo thanks again everyone for all the thoughtful posts, advice, and DD! And good luck to you all!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/liqzks/first_year_investing_review/","title":"First year investing review","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-13T04:36:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-13 04:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"liqzks","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/liqzks/first_year_investing_review/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/liqzks/first_year_investing_review/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"noshirtdude","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/noshirtdude","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"noshirtdude","score":270,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"第一年的投资回顾","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n由于现在下班时间已经结束，我可以正式说我已经赚了181.43%的收益了。\n在我第一年投资的时候，赚了7.1k左右。我想感谢各位在\n这个子。我从来没有在这里发过帖子，但我已经关注了6-7个月了。\n我的大部分选择来自于详细的帖子... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"第一年的投資回顧","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n由於現在下班時間已經結束，我可以正式說我已經賺了181.43%的收益了。\n在我第一年投資的時候，賺了7.1k左右。我想感謝各位在\n這個子。我從來沒有在這裏發過帖子，但我已經關注了6-7個月了。\n我的大部分選擇來自於詳細的帖子... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ltrc2w","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltrc2w/i_spent_more_time_on_this_than_i_like_to_admit/","title":"I spent more time on this than I like to admit","date":"February 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我花了更多的时间在这上面，我不愿意承认。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我花了更多的時間在這上面，我不願意承認。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ltqsec","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltqsec/when_we_prove_everyone_wrong/","title":"When we prove everyone wrong","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 27, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"当我们证明所有人都错了","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當我們證明所有人都錯了","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-liqzks","previousId":"RedditPost-ltrc2w","nextId":"RedditPost-ltqsec","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/liqzks/first_year_investing_review/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
