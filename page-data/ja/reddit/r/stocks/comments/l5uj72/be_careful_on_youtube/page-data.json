This individual was wrote to by a company telling him that he could make serious money by doing what he does already, all he has to do is mention a few specific penny stocks to his audience throughout his videos. This is unnerving and the company representative admitted to this YouTuber that he was already working with (and paying) dozens of popular investing channels. This is clearly a pump and dump scheme by this company in a effort to raise the penny stock’s price, only for it to crash down later. Everyone wins except the audience tuning into these videos to learn and get some investment tips. I’m sure there are genuine YouTubers out there who really want to educate and help people with investing but it’s better to be cautious and always do your own research first. Ultimately, what you do with your money has to be decided by you alone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l5uj72/be_careful_on_youtube/","title":"Be careful on YouTube.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-27T07:10:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-27 07:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l5uj72","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5uj72/be_careful_on_youtube/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5uj72/be_careful_on_youtube/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ser_antonii","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ser_antonii","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ser_antonii","score":369,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"在YouTube上要小心。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近看了一个视频，是关于一个YouTuber的视频，他揭示了一个可怕的但是\n真正的问题，发生在YouTube上。这个人是由一个\n公司告诉他，他可以通过做他所做的事情赚大钱。\n已经，他所要做的就是提到一些特定的仙股，以他的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在YouTube上要小心。","the_new_excerpt":"我最近看了一個視頻，是關於一個YouTuber的視頻，他揭示了一個可怕的但是\n真正的問題，發生在YouTube上。這個人是由一個\n公司告訴他，他可以通過做他所做的事情賺大錢。\n已經，他所要做的就是提到一些特定的仙股，以他的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ldrsgq","excerpt":"Bot hates me so here is a link [http://www.bloomberg.com/news]\n\nIn the late 90's we had a similar Tech/Digital stock rally (this is not nearly\nas bad though, so chill, companies are actually destroying the estimates and\nprofits are strong).\n\nBack then it was web page development and internet…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ldrsgq/a_story_about_the_dot_com_bubble_some_profit/","title":"A story about the Dot Com bubble, some profit taking, exit strategies and money vs capital","date":"February 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"关于Dot Com泡沫的故事，一些获利、退出策略和资金与资本的关系。","the_new_excerpt":"Bot讨厌我，所以这里有一个链接[http://www.bloomberg.com/news]\n\n在90年代末，我们也有过类似的科技股/数码股的上涨（这不是近乎\n虽说不好，但这么寒酸，公司其实是在破坏估计和。\n利润强劲）。)\n\n当年是网页开发和互联网...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於Dot Com泡沫的故事，一些獲利、退出策略和資金與資本的關係。","the_new_excerpt":"Bot討厭我，所以這裏有一個鏈接[http://www.bloomberg.com/news]\n\n在90年代末，我們也有過類似的科技股/數碼股的上漲（這不是近乎\n雖說不好，但這麼寒酸，公司其實是在破壞估計和。\n利潤強勁）。)\n\n當年是網頁開發和互聯網...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ldmi2q","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldmi2q/update_on_the_300_crew_the_world_will_know/","title":"UPDATE on the 300 Crew - THE WORLD WILL KNOW","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"最新的300名船员--世界将知道。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"最新的300名船員--世界將知道。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l5uj72","previousId":"RedditPost-ldrsgq","nextId":"RedditPost-ldmi2q","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l5uj72/be_careful_on_youtube/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
