Calpers, as the pension fund is known, disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n\n<p>Calpers, which has total assets of $445.6 billion, declined to comment on the stock trades.</p>\n\n<p>The pension bought 284,842 more American depositary receipts of the Chinese electric-vehicle maker, ending 2020 with 2.6 million ADRs. Calpers had been buying up NIO in the third quarter, as well.</p>\n\n<p>NIO ADRs rocketed more than 12 times in value last year, and so far in 2021 through Friday’s close, they were up 16.3%. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index, a broad measure of the market, rose 16.3% in 2020, and has gained 3.5% so far this year.</p>\n\n<p>NIO’s deliveries were strong in January, a bullish sign for investors, who seem to have an insatiable appetite for EV stocks. Nonetheless, NIO moved in January to raise capital through bonds.</p>\n\n<p>Calpers bought 1.8 million Activision shares in the fourth quarter, lifting its investment to 6.2 million shares of the videogame maker.</p>\n\n<p>Activision stock surged 56.3% in 2020 as the homebound stepped up their indoor gaming. So far this year, shares have gained 9.4%.</p>\n\n<p>Earnings last week topped expectations, sending Activision stock zooming. Activision said in December that its latest version of World of Warcraft is the fastest-selling PC game of all time. That announcement was on the heels of another upbeat assessment of the sales of another game.</p>\n\n<p>Walmart stock surged 21.3% in 2020, but so far this year it is nearly flat with a gain of 0.1%.</p>\n\n<p>At least one analyst thinks Walmart stock is due for another double-digit rise in 2021. The retail giant is continuing a digital push, even as its e-commerce chief retired at the end of January.</p>\n\n<p>Calpers bought 824,835 more Walmart shares in the fourth quarter, raising its holdings to 7.3 million shares.</p>\n\n<p>The pension bought 436,897 additional Target shares to raise its investment to 1.9 million shares.</p>\n\n<p>Target stock outdid Walmart’s in 2020, soaring 37.7%, and it has gained 7.0% so far this year.</p>\n\n<p>Target stock slipped in January after investors were disappointed that holiday sales weren’t stronger. The shares still have fans on Wall Street A Barron’s stock pick in the late summer, Target did quite well through the end of 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Source: Barron&#39;s</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/le02r6/biggest_us_pension_bought_more_nio_and_activision/","title":"Biggest U.S. Pension Bought More NIO and Activision Stock, and 2 Retailers","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-06T19:02:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-06 19:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"le02r6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le02r6/biggest_us_pension_bought_more_nio_and_activision/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le02r6/biggest_us_pension_bought_more_nio_and_activision/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"coolcomfort123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/coolcomfort123","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"coolcomfort123","score":88,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"美国最大养老金增持NIO和动视股票，还有2家零售商。","the_new_excerpt":"按管理资产计算，美国最大的公共养老金公司最近做出了重大举措。\n改变其投资组合。\n\n加州公共雇员退休系统买入了更多的NIO ￼（股票代码：NIO）和动视暴雪（ATVI）的股票，并提高了对其投资组合的投资。\nNIO）和动视暴雪（ATVI）的股票，并提高了对其投资。\n零售商沃尔玛（WMT）和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國最大養老金增持NIO和動視股票，還有2家零售商。","the_new_excerpt":"按管理資產計算，美國最大的公共養老金公司最近做出了重大舉措。\n改變其投資組合。\n\n加州公共僱員退休系統買入了更多的NIO ￼（股票代碼：NIO）和動視暴雪（ATVI）的股票，並提高了對其投資組合的投資。\nNIO）和動視暴雪（ATVI）的股票，並提高了對其投資。\n零售商沃爾瑪（WMT）和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lnv4xi","excerpt":"Lets take a look at Corsair Gaming.
