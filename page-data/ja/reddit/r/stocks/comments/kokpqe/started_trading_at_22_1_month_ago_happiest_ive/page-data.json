I don&#39;t make much by any means, as I work as a Traffic Control Tech, but I have big dreams and big hopes! I hope to be able to contribute $800 a month into the stock market. It&#39;s going to take a huge chunk of my paychecks, but I&#39;ve come to Spend what I don&#39;t save , rather than saving what I don&#39;t spend. I have a little over $1,000 in my trading account right now, and its the most money I&#39;ve ever managed to save up in my life. It&#39;s felt really good, and I am already ready for 2022, being that if I stay on this route,  it&#39;ll be a good year for me! And every year after that :) Happy new years all! And to any of you out there thinking about investing , I say jump in , learn as much as you can, and have fun:)</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\n  OK, so people think I&#39;m claiming a victory lap, and I simply am not. I am just taking a moment in time to reflect on the accomplishment I have made in the last month. I am not saying that this will be positive in every stride , but right now it is positive, and I&#39;d like to simply sit back and enjoy this last months accomplishment today. And maybe next month will be a different story,  but today we celebrate!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kokpqe/started_trading_at_22_1_month_ago_happiest_ive/","title":"Started trading at 22. 1 month ago.
