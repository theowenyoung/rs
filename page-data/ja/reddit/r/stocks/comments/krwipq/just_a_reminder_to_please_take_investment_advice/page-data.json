Most of it is just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1343606698896973825?s=20\">people talking into their cameras boasting high returns and advertising a paid &quot;class&quot; of their&#39;s where you can learn their secrets</a>, or just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1336360876169785344?s=20\">risky as hell advice like &quot;IPO&#39;s can only go up&quot; so you should invest in Doordash</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Especially with the stimulus package</em>, there&#39;s some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1344410208429289474?s=20\">very predatory videos</a> claiming you should use that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1346139667939340289?s=20\">$600 &quot;stimmy&quot; and get RICH QUICK</a> like them by investing in their specific stock portfolio that is GUARANTEED to go up (because past performance = guarantees right?).</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d hope that no one in their right mind would listen to this shit but there is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TikTokInvestors/status/1343613688767422464?s=20\">massive audience on Tiktok</a> that this sort of misinformation is targeted at, ie. GenZ/young investors that may only know of the stock market as of 2020. From the article I posted at the beginning on these tiktok investors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You’ve only been investing since April and have only seen a bull market since then,” they added. “Because you’re talking about money, you have hundreds of thousands following you because everyone wants to make money. You get this power very quickly... Nobody is going to call them out on their bulls***.”</p>\n\n<p>Take, for example, @kriskrohn. Kris Krohn is a Gary Vee-style motivational speaker who offers mentorships on real estate investing.</p>\n\n<p>On TikTok, he recommends that followers forgo investing via a 401(k), calling the accounts, “fake funny money,” that you “can’t use” and “can’t invest.” Instead, he advocates that his 250,000 followers invest in real estate.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the rub: Krohn was the subject of a 2012 Securities and Exchange Commission complaint for fraudulently offering and selling real estate investments. The court ruled in the SEC’s favor, and Krohn had to pay a $75,000 fine. He did not return a phone call and email seeking comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If these financial moguls were so filthy rich from their investments, why are they <em>selling</em> a class for a fee? They could easily make exponentially more by simply using their secret strategies and investing more rather than spend their time getting $20 from a teenager on tiktok...unless that&#39;s how they actually make money??</p>\n\n<p>They are snake oil salesmen repackaged to target younger generations. Don&#39;t fall for it kids.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/krwipq/just_a_reminder_to_please_take_investment_advice/","title":"Just a reminder to please take investment advice from social media with a grain of salt... there's a disturbing trend with \"TikTok Investors\" offering risky advice, especially now trying to capitalize on recent stimulus checks","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-07T01:46:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-07 01:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"krwipq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/krwipq/just_a_reminder_to_please_take_investment_advice/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/krwipq/just_a_reminder_to_please_take_investment_advice/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"HSTFU","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HSTFU","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"HSTFU","score":463,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"只是提醒一下，请对社交媒体上的投资建议持保留态度…有一种令人不安的趋势，“TikTok投资者”提供高风险的建议，特别是现在试图利用最近的刺激计划","the_new_excerpt":"我看到这个推特账号@TikTokInvestors，他们在那里屏蔽了一些很高的上限\nTikTok(又名Fintok)上的畏首畏尾的股票“大师”给出了一些疯狂的建议(文章\n所有这些，以防您不想让自己经历一些…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"只是提醒一下，請對社交媒體上的投資建議持保留態度…有一種令人不安的趨勢，“TikTok投資者”提供高風險的建議，特別是現在試圖利用最近的刺激計劃","the_new_excerpt":"我看到這個推特賬號@TikTokInvestors，他們在那裏屏蔽了一些很高的上限\nTikTok(又名Fintok)上的畏首畏尾的股票“大師”給出了一些瘋狂的建議(文章\n所有這些，以防您不想讓自己經歷一些…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l4qs9w","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4qs9w/wsb_is_singlehandedly_taking_down_wallstreet/","title":"WSB is singlehandedly taking down Wallstreet.
