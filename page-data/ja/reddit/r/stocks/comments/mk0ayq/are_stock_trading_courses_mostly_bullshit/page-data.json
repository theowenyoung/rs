First of all, the traders can have time to both trade stocks and teach courses. Surely with all the algorithms and with partners/assitants, they can make time to teach courses. Now, maybe the money they&#39;d make from these courses would be such a drop in the bucket compared to their stock earnings, making it again pointless. I&#39;m not sure about this, but a friend of mine is paying a quite sizeable sum for a trading course, and in this digital age, he could be one of many. So, perhaps there is a lot of money to make on this.</p>\n\n<p>As for the second point: surely there are many instances where cooperation is most beneficial. As a teacher of a course, one has a lot of influence over the students, being able to perhaps tell them to invest in certain businesses that would benefit them all.</p>\n\n<p>So, from my point of view, it doesn&#39;t make sense that being a teacher in a stock trading course means that one is most likely scamming the students. What do you guys think about this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mk0ayq/are_stock_trading_courses_mostly_bullshit/","title":"Are stock trading courses mostly bullshit?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-05T06:33:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-05 06:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mk0ayq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mk0ayq/are_stock_trading_courses_mostly_bullshit/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mk0ayq/are_stock_trading_courses_mostly_bullshit/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"SomeDudeOnRedditWhiz","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SomeDudeOnRedditWhiz","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"SomeDudeOnRedditWhiz","score":45,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"股票交易课程大多是扯淡吗？","the_new_excerpt":"有人告诉我，股票交易课程95％的时间是废话，他们的\n理由如下。\n\n 1. 如果股票交易员真的有好的策略，他们就不会费心了\n    把时间花在教别人上。\n 2. 教别人他们的策略是有害于他们...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"股票交易課程大多是扯淡嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"有人告訴我，股票交易課程95％的時間是廢話，他們的\n理由如下。\n\n 1. 如果股票交易員真的有好的策略，他們就不會費心了\n    把時間花在教別人上。\n 2. 教別人他們的策略是有害於他們...","locale":"zh-Hant"},{"title":"株取引の講座はほとんどがデタラメ？","the_new_excerpt":"ある人が、株取引の講座は95％がデタラメだと言っていました。\nその理由は以下の通りです。\n\n 1. 1.株式トレーダーが実際に良い戦略を持っていれば、他人に教えることに時間を割くことはない。\n    他の人に教えることに時間を使わない。\n 2. 2.他人に戦略を教えることは、自分のためにならない。","locale":"ja-JA"},{"title":"株取引の講座はほとんどがデタラメ？","the_new_excerpt":"ある人が、株取引の講座は95％がデタラメだと言っていました。\nその理由は以下の通りです。\n\n 1. 1.株式トレーダーが実際に良い戦略を持っていれば、他人に教えることに時間を割くことはない。\n    他の人に教えることに時間を使わない。\n 2. 2.他人に戦略を教えることは、自分のためにならない。","locale":"ja"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n4oegm","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4oegm/may_the_fourth_be_with_you/","title":"May the Fourth Be With You","date":"May 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"メイ・ザ・フォー・ビー・ウィズ・ユー","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"愿第四届会议与你同在","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"願第四屆會議與你同在","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-n4m397","excerpt":"The Fed can raise interest rates to infinity in lock step with rising prices to\ntame inflation when they want.
