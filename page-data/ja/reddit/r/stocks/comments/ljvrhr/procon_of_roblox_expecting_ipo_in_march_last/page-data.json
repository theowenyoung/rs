Here my thoughts on Pro/con on Roblox</p>\n\n<p>Pro:\n1. Cool business model with an entire ecosystem that drives content creation through simplified game development allowing “citizen developers” to create content which Roblox gets 30% of any revenue.  Ultra scalable content development model</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Fits into overall trend of video game nation which is clearly where the world in general is going</p></li>\n<li><p>Hasn’t even tapped the China/Asia market in any material way</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Cons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Not demonstrated to be able to keep kids outside the 4-10 age demographic. I have kids who played roblox and the games were really mini games. They then moved on to minecraft, fortnite, etc.   </p></li>\n<li><p>While the cool part is the simple way to develop games, it also inherently limits the quality and depth of games vs true coding efforts and engines like Epic Unreal engine</p></li>\n<li><p>Valuation is sky high. 7x valuation from 4bn to 29bn in one year? And this is the private round so assume people want a public valuation of 40bn+??? Compared to existing firms like Rockstar (23bn) or Electronic Arts (42bn) that very rich.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Net net: i like the overall name but as my personal investment approach is growth at a reasonable price, i will hold off but watch the name closely to see if post ipo there is a dip to a valuation i would find acceptable in the 20-30bn range</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?  What key elements of the story am i missing??</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ljvrhr/procon_of_roblox_expecting_ipo_in_march_last/","title":"Pro/Con of Roblox - expecting IPO in March.
