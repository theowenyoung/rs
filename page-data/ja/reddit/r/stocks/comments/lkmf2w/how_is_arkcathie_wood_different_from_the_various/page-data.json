Reading this thread</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ljeofr/bogleheadsorg_thread_why_the_disdain_for_managed/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ljeofr/bogleheadsorg_thread_why_the_disdain_for_managed/</a></p>\n\n<p>it&#39;s kind of sobering to realize that most actively managed funds eventually fall back to earth (sometimes even underperforming the market). I am 100% optimistic about the future of innovation and believe in Wood&#39;s vision, but history shows us that they will likely not keep up their meteoric returns. After crazy years with incredible returns (like 2020) is when most of the money piles in and the fund can no longer keep up its performance. I&#39;m highly debating whether to take profits and put it into a less sexy, more consistent fund like VOO or VTI, but I also still want to believe that ARK can pull it off.</p>\n\n<p>What are your guys&#39; thoughts? Do you have an ARK exit plan?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lkmf2w/how_is_arkcathie_wood_different_from_the_various/","title":"How is ARK/Cathie Wood different from the various rock star hot-shot funds from before?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-16T02:47:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-16 02:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lkmf2w","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lkmf2w/how_is_arkcathie_wood_different_from_the_various/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lkmf2w/how_is_arkcathie_wood_different_from_the_various/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"jdotace","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jdotace","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jdotace","score":79,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ARK/凯西木业与之前的各种摇滚明星热炒基金有什么不同？","the_new_excerpt":"这话出自一个在ARKK和ARKG上深耕细作的人之口，但是否有人\n还有人关心他们的增长是否可持续？看了这个帖子\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ljeofr/bogleheadsorg_thread_why_the_disdain_for_managed/\n\n这是一种清醒的认识到，大多数... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARK/凱西木業與之前的各種搖滾明星熱炒基金有什麼不同？","the_new_excerpt":"這話出自一個在ARKK和ARKG上深耕細作的人之口，但是否有人\n還有人關心他們的增長是否可持續？看了這個帖子\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ljeofr/bogleheadsorg_thread_why_the_disdain_for_managed/\n\n這是一種清醒的認識到，大多數... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1366537201174069248","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1366537201174069248","title":"RT @jack: 🏦 now open https://t.co/8MoWvUDny0","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @jack: 🏦现在开放https://t.co/8MoWvUDny0。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"🏦现在开放https://t.co/8MoWvUDny0。"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @jack: 🏦現在開放https://t.co/8MoWvUDny0。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"🏦現在開放https://t.co/8MoWvUDny0。"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lvbr0s","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvbr0s/its_fine_i_hate_money/","title":"It’s fine, I hate money.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"没关系，我讨厌钱。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"沒關係，我討厭錢。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lkmf2w","previousId":"TweetPost-1366537201174069248","nextId":"RedditPost-lvbr0s","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lkmf2w/how_is_arkcathie_wood_different_from_the_various/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
