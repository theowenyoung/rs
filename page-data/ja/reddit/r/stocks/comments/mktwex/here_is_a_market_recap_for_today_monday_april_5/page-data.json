The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden’s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. </p>\n\n<p>The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It [the jobs report] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”</p>\n\n<p>President Biden’s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation’s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, “ &quot;While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be “transitory,” yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative.&quot; </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares. </li>\n<li>Shares of Tesla gapped up more than 4% after the company reported better than expected March delivery numbers. Other EV companies also posted better-than-expected deliveries but didn’t rise nearly as much.</li>\n<li>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during public remarks Monday that the U.S. Treasury Department was working with other major nations to agree on a global minimum corporate tax rate, which would disincentivize companies from seeking to locate to places with lower tax rates.&quot;We’re working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom,&quot; Yellen said during virtual remarks with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.</li>\n<li>South Korea&#39;s LG Electronics Inc said on Monday it will end production and sales of its loss-making smartphone division.</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Applied Materials (AMAT) with two target raises.
