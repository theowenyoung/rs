How the same stat got thrown in my face over and over, &quot;95% of traders don&#39;t beat the market.&quot; From what I understand, there is merit to this fact.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this I&#39;ve stacked up VTI/VTSAX, VGTSX, and VOO. Since inception, I&#39;ve averaged 13% YOY. The gains are impressive since I started in about 2011-2012, with heavier contributions each year as my job came with higher salary over the years.  Easy to look good in the beginning of a decade long bull run.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Time in the market&quot; &gt; &quot;Timing the market&quot; - This is another one that seems to stand the test of time.  Constantly seeing advice on liquidating so they have &quot;cash on the side to buy the dip.&quot;  Is that not just timing the market?  Why sell unless to spend or spend during retirement?</p>\n\n<p>My question is why are subs like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/\">r/stocks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/\">r/investing</a> and such so popular, constantly everyday people posting about their super niche tailored portfolios with DD on random companies. And it seems there is a herd like mentality in these subs as well.</p>\n\n<p>Tech stocks go up - all the DD and posts are about tech stocks - everyone is bullish in tech....until its not</p>\n\n<p>Tech stocks go down - tons of QQ and posts about &quot;how is the market going up and I&#39;m down 15%?&quot; - with comments talking about OP lacking diversification.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Again if 95% of traders don&#39;t beat the market, why are so many people trying?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some things that I may not fully grasp:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are regular people building their custom portfolios, picking individual stocks not considered traders?</li>\n<li>The market has inefficiencies - does this invalidate the &quot;95% stat?&quot;</li>\n<li>Does the &quot;95% stat&quot; only apply to professionals? And by some weird way allow retail average Joes better opportunity?</li>\n<li>Why does the consensus on all the finance subs seem to be centered around building your own portfolio?</li>\n<li>Are 19/20 people in these subs really failing to beat the market?</li>\n<li>Why not just VTSAX and chill?</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/muwhxe/if_95_of_traders_dont_beat_the_market_why_are_so/","title":"If 95% of traders don't beat the market, why are so many stock subs so popular?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-20T20:26:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-20 20:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"muwhxe","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/muwhxe/if_95_of_traders_dont_beat_the_market_why_are_so/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/muwhxe/if_95_of_traders_dont_beat_the_market_why_are_so/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"HurtsFlyerin21","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HurtsFlyerin21","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"HurtsFlyerin21","score":460,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"95％のトレーダーが市場に勝てないのであれば、なぜ多くの株式サブスクが人気なのか？","the_new_excerpt":"数年前、私はファイナンシャル・アドバイザーがいかに庶民にとって恐ろしい存在であるかを知りました。\n庶民にとっていかに恐ろしいかを知った。トレーダーの95％は市場に勝てない」という同じ統計が何度も何度も私の顔に投げつけられました。\n市場に勝てない」と。私の理解では、この事実にはメリットがあります。\n\nこのため、私はVTI/VTSAX、VGTSX、VOOを積み上げてきました。以来...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"如果95%的交易者都不能战胜市场，为什么这么多的股票子会如此受欢迎？","the_new_excerpt":"几年前，我了解到财务顾问对普通人来说是多么的糟糕。\n人来说是多么可怕。同样的统计数字是如何被一次又一次地扔到我面前的，\"95%的交易者\n不能战胜市场\"。据我所知，这个事实是有道理的。\n\n正因为如此，我把VTI/VTSAX、VGTSX和VOO堆积起来。自从...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果95%的交易者都不能戰勝市場，爲什麼這麼多的股票子會如此受歡迎？","the_new_excerpt":"幾年前，我瞭解到財務顧問對普通人來說是多麼的糟糕。\n人來說是多麼可怕。同樣的統計數字是如何被一次又一次地扔到我面前的，\"95%的交易者\n不能戰勝市場\"。據我所知，這個事實是有道理的。\n\n正因爲如此，我把VTI/VTSAX、VGTSX和VOO堆積起來。自從...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mux5kq","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mux5kq/see_you_on_the_moon_a_tribute_to_keith_gill/","title":"See You on the Moon - A Tribute to Keith Gill","date":"April 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"See You on the Moon - A Tribute to Keith Gill","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"月球上见--向基思-吉尔致敬","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"月球上見--向基思-吉爾致敬","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mumlqw","excerpt":"This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme\nfor today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just\nignore the theme and/or post your arguments against TA…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mumlqw/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_apr/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Apr 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 20, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Apr 20, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"ここは毎日のディスカッションの場ですから、株に関することなら何でもいいのですが、今日のテーマはテクニカル分析（TA）です。\n今日のテーマはテクニカル分析(TA)についてですが、もしTAが苦手であれば\nしかし、TAが苦手な方は、このテーマを無視するか、TAに対するあなたの主張を投稿してください。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Apr 20, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"这是每日讨论，所以任何与股票有关的都可以，但今天的主题是技术分析（TA）。\n但今天的主题是技术分析（TA），但如果TA不是你的事，那么就请\n忽略这个主题和/或发表你反对TA的论点......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Apr 20, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"這是每日討論，所以任何與股票有關的都可以，但今天的主題是技術分析（TA）。\n但今天的主題是技術分析（TA），但如果TA不是你的事，那麼就請\n忽略這個主題和/或發表你反對TA的論點......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-muwhxe","previousId":"RedditPost-mux5kq","nextId":"RedditPost-mumlqw","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/muwhxe/if_95_of_traders_dont_beat_the_market_why_are_so/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
