The ppl demand answers!</p>\n\n<p>Vlad starts with PR shit, &quot;a little background, I&#39;m the ceo of RH&quot;</p>\n\n<p>EM - yea we know! go! hahahah &quot;So basically, wednesday we had unprecedented volume. load on system. These so-called Meme stocks were going viral on social media. A lot of net-buy activity&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Vlad - Thursday morning. I&#39;m sleeping. At 3:30am PT, our operations team recieves a file from the NSCC. As a clearing broker, we have to put up money to the NSCC based on factors. Eg. volatility. concentration. etc. The request was ~$3B. 10x more than typical.</p>\n\n<p>EM - &quot;That sounds like a lot more capital than usual. How did they calculate that?&quot; It&#39;s kinda opaque. One component is VAR (value at risk). Not a public formula. + a discretionary component.</p>\n\n<p>EM - what people want to know. Did something shady go down? Why did they demand so much money</p>\n\n<p>Vlad - I don&#39;t think it would be shady. It was unprecedented demand.</p>\n\n<p>EM - &quot;is anyone holding you hostage right now? Blink twice.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Vlad - Let&#39;s call up the higher ups at NSCC and see if we can work with them. Ended up lowering it to $1.4B (down from $3B). So we had to propose a plan to manage risk on those stocks. We said marking them sell only. Before market open, they said OK. deposit $700M.</p>\n\n<p>EM - sounds like this org held a gun to your head. Give us this money or else. Did you sell your clients down the river? Or did you have no choice? If you had no choice, then ppl want to know why. This is the most I&#39;ve ever liked elon musk. He&#39;s loose &amp; sharp asking Qs</p>\n\n<p>Elon - alright. I guess if you had no choice. you had no choice. That&#39;s understandable. But whoever put that gun to your head should have to answer to the public.</p>\n\n<p>Vlad - continues to waffle/bullshit. Not gonna type out his PR speak</p>\n\n<p>Elon - to what degree are you beholden to citadel. If citadel is unhappy - what happens?</p>\n\n<p>Vlad - there&#39;s a rumor that they pressured us. That&#39;s just false. This was a clearing house decision based on capital requirements. From our pov, citadel not involved.</p>\n\n<p>Elon - wouldn&#39;t they have a strong say with the NSCC? Vlad - I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t get into conspiracies</p>\n\n<p>Elon - alright...
