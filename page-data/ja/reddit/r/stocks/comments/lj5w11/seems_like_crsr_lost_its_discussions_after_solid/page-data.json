I think we are currently at this point of consolidation before a upturn. It has held around $42 for a few days now, and with money coming out of Weed stocks and possibly out of pump and dump selections, it only seems logical that money will start being put back into safer, profitable, future potential companies. </p>\n\n<p>This is why I like CRSR, I have seen reports saying it&#39;s new price point is $50+. I agree with that price, and think that is a very safe evaluation with the possibility of reaching $60 by end of year. </p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t a DD, if you want to read up on it, check around all the subs, plenty of great long detailed posts discussing their potential. I am just reminding people to not forget about it if you are looking for a safer investment after making money (or losing) on the recent pump and dumps. </p>\n\n<p>;TLDR - CRSR has plenty of future potential, looks like it&#39;s hit it&#39;s support level and should start to trend back upwards. Take a look for yourself at the many great DDs posted before earnings, and then at how well they did last few quarters. Very large upside potential here for the long term as a safer investment. </p>\n\n<p>Do your own DD, but I think it looks like a safe entry point with little downside.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lj5w11/seems_like_crsr_lost_its_discussions_after_solid/","title":"Seems like CRSR lost its discussions after SOLID earnings.
