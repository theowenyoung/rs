My gut tells me that TSLA is not more valuable than all the world’s other car companies combined.  They have first-mover advantage in EVs but I feel like other car companies will close this gap quickly.  Established manufacturers have the infrastructure in place and after some initial costs and challenges converting to EV I think at least some will emerge as viable contenders.  This leads me to question tsla share price over the next decade, as they no longer are the only really impressive EV.  This is just a gut feeling I would love to hear better insight either way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lwt43o/teslas_competitive_advantage_in_the_next_decade/","title":"Tesla’s competitive advantage in the next decade","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-03T19:06:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-03 19:06","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lwt43o","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lwt43o/teslas_competitive_advantage_in_the_next_decade/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lwt43o/teslas_competitive_advantage_in_the_next_decade/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Rang_Dipkin","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Rang_Dipkin","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Rang_Dipkin","score":76,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"特斯拉未来十年的竞争优势","the_new_excerpt":"我想从特斯拉的牛市和熊市中得到一些启示，他们在什么地方\n认为特斯拉会从这里开始。我的直觉告诉我，TSLA不比\n全球所有其他汽车公司的总和。他们有先发优势，在\n电动车，但我觉得其他车企会缩小这个差距... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉未來十年的競爭優勢","the_new_excerpt":"我想從特斯拉的牛市和熊市中得到一些啓示，他們在什麼地方\n認爲特斯拉會從這裏開始。我的直覺告訴我，TSLA不比\n全球所有其他汽車公司的總和。他們有先發優勢，在\n電動車，但我覺得其他車企會縮小這個差距... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m7i1yk","excerpt":"Picture book DD since 🦍🦍🦍 no like read\n\n20 MM USD was spent on the 800C 3/19 so far this week\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aso8z03pepn61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8314dd277b4ada03e5484caa8da4271cdf4bd8e\n\nWhich resulted in very minimum delta hedging by the MMs, next week The Calls OI\nwill…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7i1yk/why_gme_only_moved_079_on_stimmy_wednesday/","title":"Why $GME only moved +0.79% on stimmy Wednesday","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么$GME在周三的刺激下只走了+0.79%？","the_new_excerpt":"绘本DD自🦍🦍🦍没有喜欢的读物。\n\n本周至今在800C 3/19上花费了20MM美元。\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aso8z03pepn61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8314dd277b4ada03e5484caa8da4271cdf4bd8e\n\n这导致MM们的delta对冲非常少，下周The Calls OI\n将...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼$GME在週三的刺激下只走了+0.79%？","the_new_excerpt":"繪本DD自🦍🦍🦍沒有喜歡的讀物。\n\n本週至今在800C 3/19上花費了20MM美元。\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aso8z03pepn61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8314dd277b4ada03e5484caa8da4271cdf4bd8e\n\n這導致MM們的delta對沖非常少，下週The Calls OI\n將...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m7tp5e","excerpt":"u/DeepFuckingValue [https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/] has gained a lot\nof popularity for his incredible ROI this year.\n\nMany people wait for his famous \"YOLO UPDATE\" that he posts every now and then.\n\nWe all look at them and we can only dream of having such returns, having so much\nmoney,…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7tp5e/the_importance_of_dfvs_example/","title":"The Importance of DFV's Example","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 18, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"DFV的例子的重要性","the_new_excerpt":"u/DeepFuckingValue[https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/]收获颇丰\n的人气，因为他今年惊人的投资回报率。\n\n很多人都在等待他那著名的 \"YOLO UPDATE\"，他每隔一段时间就会发布一次。\n\n我们都看在眼里，我们做梦都想拥有这样的回报，拥有这么多的\n钱，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DFV的例子的重要性","the_new_excerpt":"u/DeepFuckingValue[https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/]收穫頗豐\n的人氣，因爲他今年驚人的投資回報率。\n\n很多人都在等待他那著名的 \"YOLO UPDATE\"，他每隔一段時間就會發布一次。\n\n我們都看在眼裏，我們做夢都想擁有這樣的回報，擁有這麼多的\n錢，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lwt43o","previousId":"RedditPost-m7i1yk","nextId":"RedditPost-m7tp5e","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lwt43o/teslas_competitive_advantage_in_the_next_decade/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
