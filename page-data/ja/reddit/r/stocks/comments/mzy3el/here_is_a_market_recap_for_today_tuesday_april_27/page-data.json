Altogether, the market caps of the companies reporting this week comprise nearly half the total market cap of the S&amp;P 500, according to FactSet. So far, the vast majority of companies have vastly exceeded analyst estimates, with effective vaccine distribution in the US helping stoke demand as the economy gradually reopens. </p>\n\n<p>Eighty-four percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results to date posted a positive earnings per share surprise, according to data from FactSet. This would mark the highest percentage of companies reporting upside surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, assuming this beat rate holds through the end of earnings season. </p>\n\n<p>Today kicked off the first of the FOMC’s two-day rate-setting meeting. The event is extremely unlikely to lead to any major shifts in monetary policy, with officials reiterating their commitment to keeping policy highly accommodative as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic. This includes maintaining interest rates near zero and maintaining an aggressive asset purchasing program at a monthly rate of $120 billion. In an earlier meeting, Powell said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program “well before” raising interest rates. Powell said, “We will taper asset purchases when we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.”</p>\n\n<p>In other news, according to a report by the Conference Board, consumer confidence has surged to a 14-month high in April as effective distribution of the vaccine and easing of social distancing guidelines in the US allows for the economy to gradually reopen. The Conference Board&#39;s monthly consumer confidence index jumped to a reading of 121.7 in April, or well above the 113.0 expected. Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement, “Consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved significantly in April, suggesting the economic recovery strengthened further in early Q2. Consumers’ optimism about the short-term outlook held steady this month. Consumers were more upbeat about their income prospects, perhaps due to the improving job market and the recent round of stimulus checks.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Home price growth advanced further in February as tight inventory and still-strong demand weighed further on home affordability. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/case-shiller-home-price-february-2021-130007537.html\">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index </a>accelerated at a 11.97% year-over-year rate in February, according to a new report Tuesday morning.
