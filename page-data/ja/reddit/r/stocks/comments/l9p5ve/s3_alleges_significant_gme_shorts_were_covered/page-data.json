Many data companies like S3 and OPEX can only speculate. From what I read on his twitter, their algos somehow try to predict how much is being covered based on how the stock loan interest % changes. This week it dropped significantly to &lt;30% I believe, meaning that there is less associated risk with their shorts, which somehow correlates to how many have been covered within the volume Wednesday-Friday</p>\n\n<p>Is their speculation wrong? How does it compare to OPEX? Have they given in to Citadel?
