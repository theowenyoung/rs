It’s due to a lack of experience, however thanks to the Dunning-Kruger Effect these people often feel superior to seasoned investors....including Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch and academics. </p>\n\n<p>It used to be that I’d come across down right nonsensical (worse than bad) posts or comments every other week. However in the past month that number has increased to once every other day....and sorry but it mostly comes from the dividend investing crowd and the TSLA fan-Boiz. </p>\n\n<p>Today I was trying to explain to someone what Dividend irrelevance theory is...and somehow this person determined that you can have a 13% “guaranteed” rate of return no matter what the stock price does; meaning the stock can crash 90% and your rate of return is still +13% or more for the year. Well turns out this guy calculates his rate of return by the number of shares bought buy his DRIP per stock....rather than growth/loss in the value of your investments. And ofc he felt like he cracked the investing code of ancient wisdom that us plebs don’t know. So his idea was to buy high yield stocks, hold on and never sell....according to this user it was impossible to lose money with a dividend stock because it always pays a dividend.....I think this takes the cake for worst advice/logic I’ve seen on this sub and that’s saying a lot. </p>\n\n<p>So I think it’s a great time to remind people. Be careful whom you take advice from. Especially on Reddit and YouTube. There’s a few users out there that are good, but the majority don’t know what they’re doing half the time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mcoy9k/be_careful_with_what_you_read_on_rstocks/","title":"Be careful with what you read on r/stocks","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-25T07:00:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-25 07:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mcoy9k","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mcoy9k/be_careful_with_what_you_read_on_rstocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mcoy9k/be_careful_with_what_you_read_on_rstocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"The_Texidian","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Texidian","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"The_Texidian","score":437,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"小心你在r/stocks上读到的东西。","the_new_excerpt":"Yikes.....这就是我要说的。\n\n已经注意到，帖子和评论的质量已经下降，随着\n新手投资者的涌入。这是由于缺乏经验，然而由于\n邓宁-克鲁格效应，这些人往往觉得自己比老练的人更优秀\n投资者....，包括沃伦...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"小心你在r/stocks上讀到的東西。","the_new_excerpt":"Yikes.....這就是我要說的。\n\n已經注意到，帖子和評論的質量已經下降，隨着\n新手投資者的湧入。這是由於缺乏經驗，然而由於\n鄧寧-克魯格效應，這些人往往覺得自己比老練的人更優秀\n投資者....，包括沃倫...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mtwwxf","excerpt":"These daily discussions run from Monday to Friday including during our themed\nposts.\n\nSome helpful links:\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd] for charts, fundamentals, and\n   aggregated news on individual stocks\n * Bloomberg market news [https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n   *…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mtwwxf/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_apr_19_2021/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Monday - Apr 19, 2021","date":"April 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"r/Stocks デイリーディスカッション 月曜日 - 2021年4月19日","the_new_excerpt":"毎日のディスカッションは、月曜から金曜まで、テーマごとに行われます。\nが行われます。\n\n役に立つリンクをご紹介します。\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd] チャート、ファンダメンタルズ、個別銘柄の集約されたニュースのための\n   チャート、ファンダメンタルズ、個々の銘柄のニュースを集約したFinviz []\n * Bloomberg market news [https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n   *...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"r/股票每日讨论 星期一 - 2021年4月19日","the_new_excerpt":"每天的讨论从周一到周五，包括在我们的主题讨论期间，我们都会进行。\n岗位。\n\n一些有用的链接。\n\n * Finviz[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd]，提供图表、基本要素和\n   个股汇总\n * 彭博市场新闻[https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n   *…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/股票每日討論 星期一 - 2021年4月19日","the_new_excerpt":"每天的討論從週一到週五，包括在我們的主題討論期間，我們都會進行。\n崗位。\n\n一些有用的鏈接。\n\n * Finviz[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd]，提供圖表、基本要素和\n   個股彙總\n * 彭博市場新聞[https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n   *…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mu208m","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mu208m/borrow_rate_cranked_from_183_to_196_this_morning/","title":"Borrow rate cranked from 18.3 to 19.6 this morning on AMC.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 19, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"今朝のAMCでは、借入金利が18.3から19.6に上昇しました。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"今天上午AMC的借款利率从18.3调至19.6。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天上午AMC的借款利率從18.3調至19.6。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mcoy9k","previousId":"RedditPost-mtwwxf","nextId":"RedditPost-mu208m","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mcoy9k/be_careful_with_what_you_read_on_rstocks/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
