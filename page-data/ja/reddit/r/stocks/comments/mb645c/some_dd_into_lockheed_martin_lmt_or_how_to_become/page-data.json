Their current fair value is $415 and the sit at $350 they pay some of the highest dividends on the market as well at 3%. Not to mention Biden will keep dropping bombs and the company is essentially the research and development arm of our military and the very definition of too big to fail (74% of business is US) not only due to their size but because of the extremely sensitive national security secrets they possess (if aliens are real these are the people reverse engineering their craft). They build the F35 which will bring in 406 billion dollars in sales as well as 1.1 TRILLION dollars in operations and Maintennace. They have embedded options in space which is another trillion dollar market. Oh and they are merging with Aerojet Rocketdyne one of the biggest missile manufacturers. They will make the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic. Q4 2020 saw record shattering sales across all 4 business sectors (aeronautics +11%, rotary and mission systems +9%, missiles and fire control +11%, space +9%. They shave also substantially reduced debt as well as shares outstanding. Did I mention a 147 billion dollar backlog (up 3B from last year)?</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: this is the very definition of a value play. Buy and hold as much as reasonably possible below $350 ideally, but anywhere below $400 will do. Hold. Hold. Hold. Until the US decides to go a year without increasing the defense budget, the country goes bankrupt, or world peace suddenly breaks out. I&#39;d take this over a savings accnt anyday. </p>\n\n<p>I am not a financial advisor and this is totally not financial advice.
