Like many, I was swept up in the recent meme stock mania.

From Youtubers posting package thieves to cheaters caught on camera, I think the trend is here to stay.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Update 1 - 3/11/21</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sold: 14 shares of $ARLO @ $8/share (+14% gain)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rationale: Recent <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/10/verkada-hack-surveillance-risk/\">news</a> about security cam hacks has me nervous about the short term for this stock.</li>\n<li>Bought: 7 shared of $FNKO @ $15.50/share</li>\n<li>Rationale: Good market share, positive EPS in Q3 2020, and they beat estimates by a wide margin. They are also reporting earnings this afternoon. I think their products are reasonably priced, popular, and Covid is keeping people indoors, decorating their home offices with small low-priced figurines.
