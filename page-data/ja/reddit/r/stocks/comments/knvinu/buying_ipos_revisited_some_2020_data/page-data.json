I focused on &quot;popular&quot; IPOs to capture the FOMO phenomenon with the highly anticipated IPOs.  The result was clear that it almost always makes sense to wait 6-12 months because in a very high % of cases, the stocks dropped to a price below the opening price at some point, and usually reached the lowest price within the first 6 months.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we&#39;re hitting the end of 2020 I decided to look at some of the IPOs from this year.  I went back and recorded every IPO in June through Sept which takes us back 3-6 months.  I then eliminated a bunch of very thinly traded SPACs that have hardly moved since their IPO.  That left me with a sample of 72 IPOs during that time frame.  Here&#39;s what I found:</p>\n\n<p>Number of stocks that opened trading at a higher price than the IPO price: 60/72 (83.3%)</p>\n\n<p>Number of stocks that subsequently dropped to a price below the opening price: <strong>71/72 (98.6%)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Number of stocks that subsequently dropped to a price below the IPO price: 27/72 (37.5%)</p>\n\n<p>Number of stocks currently trading below the opening trade price: 16/72 (22.2%)</p>\n\n<p>I draw a few interesting conclusions from this data:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Like my other studies, this data confirms the &quot;bowl&quot; pattern that is very common with IPOs: the price opens high, subsequently drops to a lower price, and then generally climbs above the opening price.</li>\n<li>Buying an IPO on the day of the IPO is a huge, huge mistake.  In 98.6% of cases, literally all but one, investors could have gotten a lower price.  In some cases that would have been an intraday low on the IPO day, but in most cases the low came in the days/weeks after the IPO.</li>\n<li>I don&#39;t know if this is a phenomenon particular to 2020 without doing the same analysis for previous years, but the data clearly demonstrates the FOMO that occurs around IPOs.  In 83% of cases the stock opened trading at a price higher than the IPO price, which means public demand pushed the price above the price set by the company.  And notice that although the price dropped below the opening trade price in 98.6% of cases, it only dropped below the IPO price in 37.5% of cases.  This would suggest that the actual IPO price is a much more accurate representation of the value of the stock, and any stock that opens trading much higher than the IPO price should be avoided until it drops.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/knvinu/buying_ipos_revisited_some_2020_data/","title":"Buying IPOs revisited - some 2020 data","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-01T10:42:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-01 10:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"knvinu","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/knvinu/buying_ipos_revisited_some_2020_data/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/knvinu/buying_ipos_revisited_some_2020_data/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"SirGasleak","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SirGasleak","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"SirGasleak","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"重新考虑购买IPO-一些2020年的数据","the_new_excerpt":"不久前，我发布了一些关于IPO的研究结果，这些研究可以追溯到\n2012年，看看在IPO日购买IPO是否有意义，还是等待。我集中精力\n论以万众期待捕捉FOMO现象的“热门”IPO\n首次公开募股。结果很明显，这对…来说几乎总是有意义的","locale":"zh"},{"title":"重新考慮購買IPO-一些2020年的數據","the_new_excerpt":"不久前，我發佈了一些關於IPO的研究結果，這些研究可以追溯到\n2012年，看看在IPO日購買IPO是否有意義，還是等待。我集中精力\n論以萬衆期待捕捉FOMO現象的“熱門”IPO\n首次公開募股。結果很明顯，這對…來說幾乎總是有意義的","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l2dy6k","excerpt":"Hello investors of reddit.\n\nI know in today’s market we are seeing companies breaking their all time price\nrecords day in and day out, companies being traded at p/e and p/b ratios that\nwould give Benjamin graham and warren Buffett heart attacks.
