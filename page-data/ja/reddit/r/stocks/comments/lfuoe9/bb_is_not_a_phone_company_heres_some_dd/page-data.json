Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs. </p>\n\n<p>They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies and who also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.</p>\n\n<p>If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I also want to point out by looking at the TA from February 2nd, BB is the only stock with a higher moving average to that of GME AMC and NOK. Throughout last week we can see it breaking the meme trend and acting on its own. Sorry I’m not sure how to add pictures but if you have the resources, you’ll see if you overlay all 4 stocks, they move very similar, but BB is the only one that breaks out right before market close. </p>\n\n<p>EOY target is $60</p>\n\n<p>BB Literally to the moon </p>\n\n<p>17c 3/5 @20</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfuoe9/bb_is_not_a_phone_company_heres_some_dd/","title":"BB is not a phone company.
