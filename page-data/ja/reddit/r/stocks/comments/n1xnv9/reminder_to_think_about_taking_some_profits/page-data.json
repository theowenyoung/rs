I realize how beat up EV, weed and micro caps are (though they did bounce this week).  We are at the quarter end. The big earnings week is coming to a close. Earnings were &quot;as expected&quot; even though the spin is &quot;exceeded expectations.&quot; The expectation of investors was that these companies would exceed expectations which is why the beginning of the month had so many buyers.</p>\n\n<p>There is going to be selling pressure over the next few days (maybe weeks). Lots of people sell after earnings simply because they don&#39;t want to hold for another three months and there are no positive catalysts in the near term to move the stock. This doesn&#39;t mean the company did anything wrong but the share price does come down. If there are enough buyers on the sidelines the prices won&#39;t move much but there will definitely be an increase of sellers out of some positions. </p>\n\n<p>Moving on to next quarter. There are a lot of supply issues and increased costs that many companies noted in their earning calls. We all know about the semi-conductor issue. Raw material costs are approaching all time highs in many sectors. Companies are raising their sale prices. The full impact of these issues won&#39;t be fully realized until the next earnings call but in preparation for that people are moving out of some of those stocks that they feel are most vulnerable. </p>\n\n<p>Also of note, as many in this forum have noted, the investments made over the &quot;Covid crash&quot; are now at their &quot;long term&quot; status and profit taking due to this will occur (is occurring) as well. &quot;Sell in May and go away&quot; is a load of crap but many people know the saying and CNBC (among others) will be using it liberally. </p>\n\n<p>These are just facts I am pointing out that are working against the market in the near term. It is your decision whether it matters or not to you. Among this will also be the &quot;jobs, inflation, rate hike, covid, stimulus, etc&quot; drama over the next few weeks (as is the usual). That can go either way and nobody knows anything for sure. There will definitely be a lot of reporting about summer travel after Covid! This will boost the re-opening plays from time to time. Also the infrastructure package will be a talking point to look forward to. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR There will be selling pressure over the next couple of weeks which could escalate if there are not enough buyers rushing in quick enough. These buyers would hold off if &quot;bad news&quot; comes out during that time which would push share prices lower. There is definitely quite a bit of cash waiting for a buying opportunity but that usually takes an 8-10% correction to move in. It will recover over time (as always) but if you were looking to sell in the next few months there is nothing wrong with taking SOME profit at this level. If you are in it for over a year disregard this post. </p>\n\n<p>I am not telling you what to do. I am reminding you to think about what to do. You are responsible for your own decisions. Good luck out there!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/n1xnv9/reminder_to_think_about_taking_some_profits/","title":"Reminder to think about taking SOME profits.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-30T21:15:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-30 21:15","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n1xnv9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n1xnv9/reminder_to_think_about_taking_some_profits/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n1xnv9/reminder_to_think_about_taking_some_profits/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"GMEgotmehere","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GMEgotmehere","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"GMEgotmehere","score":99,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"利益を出すことを考えなければならない。","the_new_excerpt":"もしあなたが今後12ヶ月以上にわたって株式を保有するのであれば、この投稿は無視してください。\n\nこの記事は、マイクロキャップ（投機的な遊び）についてではなく、大規模なキャップの会社についての記事です。\n企業についてです。私は、EV、雑草、マイクロキャップがどれほど叩かれているかを理解しています（今週は跳ねましたが\n今週は跳ねましたが）。) 私たちは今、四半期末を迎えています。大企業は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"提醒大家考虑获取一些利润。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你在未来12个月以上都持有你的股票，那么请不要理会这篇文章。\n\n这不是关于微型股（投机性游戏），而是关于大型股\n公司。我意识到电动车、杂草和微型股有多受打击（尽管它们本周确实\n本周反弹了）。) 我们正处于季度末。大盘股和小盘股都是如此。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"提醒大家考慮獲取一些利潤。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你在未來12個月以上都持有你的股票，那麼請不要理會這篇文章。\n\n這不是關於微型股（投機性遊戲），而是關於大型股\n公司。我意識到電動車、雜草和微型股有多受打擊（儘管它們本週確實\n本週反彈了）。) 我們正處於季度末。大盤股和小盤股都是如此。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n1z8yy","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1z8yy/all_in_gme/","title":"All in #GME","date":"April 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GMEのすべて","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"所有在#GME","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"所有在#GME","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-n2468b","excerpt":"\"Palantir USG Inc., Palo Alto, California, has been awarded a $32,500,000\nfirm-fixed-price contract that provides data-as-a-service platform for two\nseparate mission areas.
