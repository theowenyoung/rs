Merwin, CFA, said Palantir posted &quot;strong FQ4 results&quot; that beat their revenue and EBITDA expectations by 6% and 115% respectively.\nThey also noted Palantir&#39;s robust revenue guidance and backlog of orders going into 2021.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We were encouraged to see management guide to $4bn of revenue in FY25, implying a 30% 5-year CAGR from FY20,&quot; Merwin said. &quot;With a growing backlog of $2.8bn in deal value (+31% y/y), we believe there is increasing visibility into the achievability of that long-term target.&quot;\nGovernment revenue was another bright spot for Palantir in its most recent earnings report, rising 85% year-over-year to $190 million. The company signed 21 deals worth over $5 million with contractors during the quarter compared to just 15 a year ago.\nGoldman analysts also said they expect the margin expansion of 63 points seen in the quarter to continue going forward, leading the group to model 23% non-GAAP EBIT, up from 17%.\nFurthermore, Goldman said Palantir&#39;s deal with IBM to &quot;should help to grow what is a relatively small commercial customer count today.&quot;\nPalantir&#39;s quarterly results were enough for Goldman to more than double its price target from $13 per share to $34. The company should now &quot;trade more in line with 30%+ growth businesses, which are trading at 44x CY21 sales&quot; according to Merwin and his team.</p>\n\n<p>Goldman&#39;s price target implies a 22% potential return from Tuesday&#39;s closing price.\nPalantir&#39;s stock has risen nearly 200% in the last six months amid a bull market for equities. However, the company saw its shares fall from all-time-highs of over $39 per share on Jan. 27.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/llwpbc/palantir_upgraded_to_buy_with_a_fresh_34_price/","title":"Palantir upgraded to 'buy' with a fresh $34 price target from Goldman Sachs after revealing 'sustainable growth' in latest earnings","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T16:20:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 16:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"llwpbc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llwpbc/palantir_upgraded_to_buy_with_a_fresh_34_price/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llwpbc/palantir_upgraded_to_buy_with_a_fresh_34_price/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"NineteenSixtySix","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NineteenSixtySix","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"NineteenSixtySix","score":4696,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Palantir在最新财报中透露 \"可持续增长 \"后，高盛将Palantir上调至 \"买入\"，新目标价为34美元。","the_new_excerpt":"文章\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/palantir-stock-price-goldman-sachs-q4-earnings-analysis-2021-2-1030092816]\n\nPalantir Technologies获得了新的 \"买入 \"评级，目标价为34美元。\n高盛周三。虽然这家大数据分析公司的股价以\n跌跌撞撞","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Palantir在最新財報中透露 \"可持續增長 \"後，高盛將Palantir上調至 \"買入\"，新目標價爲34美元。","the_new_excerpt":"文章\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/palantir-stock-price-goldman-sachs-q4-earnings-analysis-2021-2-1030092816]\n\nPalantir Technologies獲得了新的 \"買入 \"評級，目標價爲34美元。\n高盛週三。雖然這家大數據分析公司的股價以\n跌跌撞撞","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lwk046","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwk046/update_gme_in_full_phineas_mode/","title":"UPDATE: $GME in full Phineas mode","date":"March 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"更新：$GME完全进入Phineas模式。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"更新：$GME完全進入Phineas模式。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1366888495722213379","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1366888495722213379","title":"US National Debt moves above $28 trillion for the first time, increasing $4.6 trillion over the last year. https://t.co/IkhSWw209B","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 03, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国国债首次突破28万亿美元 去年增加4.6万亿美元https://t.co/IkhSWw209B。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國國債首次突破28萬億美元 去年增加4.6萬億美元https://t.co/IkhSWw209B。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-llwpbc","previousId":"RedditPost-lwk046","nextId":"TweetPost-1366888495722213379","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/llwpbc/palantir_upgraded_to_buy_with_a_fresh_34_price/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
