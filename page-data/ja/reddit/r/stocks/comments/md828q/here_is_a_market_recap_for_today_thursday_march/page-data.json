Market participants continue to monitor recent comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the Treasury yield, and the coronavirus situation in Europe. </p>\n\n<p>In an interview with NPR&#39;s Morning Edition Thursday morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done &quot;gradually over time, and with great transparency.&quot; This is the latest in a long string of comments from Powell and other monetary officials, like Janet Yellen, that point to the maintenance of accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future. </p>\n\n<p>However, despite Powell’s consistency in his statements, many market participants continue to fear that coming inflationary pressures could cause the Fed to tighten monetary policy earlier than expected. Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo said, “This will be the first time that every country in the world is emerging from recession simultaneously. And the Fed and other policymakers are banking on this idea that it’ll be a relatively short strain on supply chains but eventually, things get up and running again and you can get the input components to where they’re most needed.” </p>\n\n<p>The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to hover around 1.6%, falling from 1.75% earlier in the week. Despite the decline, the Treasury yield remains at elevated levels compared to 12 months ago, with the expectation that the yield will continue climbing as the economy reopens and recovers. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical [sectors] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.</p>\n\n<p>We agree, rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today&#39;s dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. </p>\n\n<p>Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to &quot;wash up on our shores.&quot; Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Moreover, earlier in the week the, US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine (<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84\">Report by the Associated Press</a>).  In a late-night news release Wednesday, AstraZeneca said it had analyzed more data from that study and concluded the vaccine is 76% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, instead of the 79% it had reported earlier in the week, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-strong-protection-us-rift-466726258e5e546550907f123f67763d\">insisting the vaccine was “strongly effective” against the virus. </a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First-time unemployment claims fell to 684,000 last week from 781,000 a week earlier.
