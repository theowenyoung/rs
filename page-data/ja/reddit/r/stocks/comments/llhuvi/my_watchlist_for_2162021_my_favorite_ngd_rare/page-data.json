I really think this is a great play, hopefully it over takes the 200EMA soon. Vortex and Stoch is low, RSI is consolidating. Good value.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$AMGN - Gorgeous channel up right now, I really love it. Right at support a well, just broke the 200EMA which isn&#39;t great. All indicators are low, but a great value here.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$CHRS - Tanked right into where you want it! Could be a tad lower, but it is a good value still. All indicators very low, and this is just a purely great price action play.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$IAG  - Could be a smidge lower, but it looks really good here. Indicators look great, I really enjoy this value.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$NGD  - Fantastic trend up looking great here. Support is right here, and so is the trendline up. All indicators are low, and it looks like a great pick up.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$RARE - Support area is right here, and trend up is also right here. Give it another day or two, but this is a beautiful setup right here. Indicators are low, so reversal coming.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$RIDE - 200EMA bounce right in trend line and at support? Love it. Indicators are all super low, this is a great pick up right here - A1 setup.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$SURF - 200EMA bounce. One of my favorite stocks to abuse, looking super good here. I just love it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/llhuvi/my_watchlist_for_2162021_my_favorite_ngd_rare/","title":"My Watchlist For 2/16/2021 ---- MY FAVORITE: NGD, RARE, RIDE, SURF","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T13:00:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 13:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"llhuvi","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llhuvi/my_watchlist_for_2162021_my_favorite_ngd_rare/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llhuvi/my_watchlist_for_2162021_my_favorite_ngd_rare/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"No_Seesaw1134","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Seesaw1134","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"No_Seesaw1134","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"2/16/2021我的观察清单 ---- 我的最爱：NGD, RARE, RIDE, SURF。","the_new_excerpt":"我使用180D/4H图进行大多数设置。我也使用RSI，随机指标，涡旋指标。\n和10-50-200EMA线.但最重要的是，价格行动是关键。\n\n我的最爱：NGD、RARE、RIDE、SURF。\n\n\n\n$ACI - 美丽的通道了，现在。我真的认为这是一个伟大的发挥。\n希望它能超过200EMA...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2/16/2021我的觀察清單 ---- 我的最愛：NGD, RARE, RIDE, SURF。","the_new_excerpt":"我使用180D/4H圖進行大多數設置。我也使用RSI，隨機指標，渦旋指標。\n和10-50-200EMA線.但最重要的是，價格行動是關鍵。\n\n我的最愛：NGD、RARE、RIDE、SURF。\n\n\n\n$ACI - 美麗的通道了，現在。我真的認爲這是一個偉大的發揮。\n希望它能超過200EMA...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lwg1pw","excerpt":"I started investing back in march of 2020 when the market was tanking.
