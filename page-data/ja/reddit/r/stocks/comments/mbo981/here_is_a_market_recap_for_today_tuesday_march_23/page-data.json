Moreover, a rise in COVID-19 cases in Europe prompted a new lockdown in Germany. </p>\n\n<p>Market participants closely monitored remarks from both Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.”</p>\n\n<p>While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market remains volatile, with Treasury yields rising once again in anticipation of strong economic recovery and inflationary fears that could cause the Fed to reign back sooner-than-expected. We think the fear is overblown, given the Fed’s consistency in this stance. </p>\n\n<p>Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today&#39;s dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. </p>\n\n<p>Early today, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to &quot;wash up on our shores.&quot; Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine (<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84\">Report by the Associated Press</a>). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Gamestop (GME) earnings today, we have popcorn ready to go!
