I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>In the end the two I landed on were:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php\">Unbias Stock</a>: It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finviz.com/?a=304482240\">Finviz</a>: The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/edit?usp=sharing\">I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here&#39;s a Google Sheet with the data</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Methodologies:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet</li>\n<li>Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before</li>\n<li>The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker &quot;high&quot; for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you&#39;ll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data</li>\n<li>It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are\n\n<ul>\n<li>What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)</li>\n<li>Which social media is the most profitable?</li>\n<li>What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)</li>\n<li>How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing</li>\n<li>Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money</li>\n<li>Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category</li>\n<li>They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money</li>\n<li>Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other interesting finds:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it&#39;s a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasible</p>\n\n<p>StockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they&#39;re not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it&#39;s not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Obviously I&#39;m not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I&#39;ve been using the data to do is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven&#39;t popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on them<br/>\nThis strategy has been working really well for me. I&#39;m hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don&#39;t I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I&#39;ve only taken a loss twice</li>\n<li>I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far</li>\n<li>I started this a month ago in my RH account (it&#39;s where my play money is) and compared it to my &quot;responsible&quot; investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I&#39;m more than happy to make this better.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/","title":"A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T17:16:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 17:16","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m71xi8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TheIndulgery","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheIndulgery","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"TheIndulgery","score":3431,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"一个月跟踪刮股机的成功/失败率。","the_new_excerpt":"我们都看到了，每个人和他们的兄弟都有一个股票提刮器这些\n天，所以我想我会开始跟踪他们。我在寻找那些会\n给出最清晰的策略概念，可以进行实际交易。\n因此，它必须有一致的更新，是可靠的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個月跟蹤刮股機的成功/失敗率。","the_new_excerpt":"我們都看到了，每個人和他們的兄弟都有一個股票提刮器這些\n天，所以我想我會開始跟蹤他們。我在尋找那些會\n給出最清晰的策略概念，可以進行實際交易。\n因此，它必須有一致的更新，是可靠的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mm43ro","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mm43ro/calling_your_bluff_hf_im_all_in/","title":"Calling your bluff HF!
