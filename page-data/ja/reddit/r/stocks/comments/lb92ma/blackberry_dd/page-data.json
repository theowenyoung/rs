I hold ~4k shares of bb and started buying at ~4$ with an overall average cost of ~12$.</p>\n\n<p>One thing that really annoyed me during this whole GME saga is somehow BB became a meme stock and the target of a &quot;short squeeze&quot; (SI is like 8%) with people piling on OTM calls and weeklys saying it&#39;s going to triple in a month. BB is a solid long term hold that&#39;s misvalued by the broad market.</p>\n\n<p>Valuation</p>\n\n<p>BB is currently valued at about 6.5B market cap as of closing Feb 2 2021. For a software company valued at 6.5B in today&#39;s market you would think it does like 100M a year in sales. Nope, BB is actually about a billion with 475M in annual recurring revenue with 26% y/y growth. Similar companies such as Okta and Crwd are currently at ~36B and 49B respectively. Those companies have better growth numbers but neither are profitable and should not justify an 8x price premium. Just taking annual recurring revenue assuming most of it is the software segment which grows at 26% y/y at 20 p/s alone gives ~10b value (50% upside from today&#39;s price).</p>\n\n<p>Current business and future business</p>\n\n<p>BB has not sold a phone in like 5 years. It has completely phased itself out into a pure software company. It&#39;s main lines of business are software for cars (QNX) and cybersecurity for enterprises and government (9/10 top automakers, 9/10 largest global banks, 18/20 G20 governments) all of which are relatively recession proof and once integrated hard to replace. QNX has the highest security certification from the international stadard for functional safety of electrical systems for road vehicles (ISO 26262) that not even Tesla has. They also have Canada&#39;s largest patent portfolio at over 38k. I feel all of this points to a diverse business that can withstand economic downturns supported by clients with effectively infinite money (printer go brrr).</p>\n\n<p>Blackberry and AWS</p>\n\n<p>The big news in recent months was the announcement of BB IVY a partnership with AWS. IVY is a cloud based big data platform for cars. People say tesla is not a car company but a data company due to all the data they gather. When all other car companies want to gather their own data IVY comes in. If they&#39;re already on QNX i&#39;d imagine the integration will be seamless. The possibilites are endless as cars gather more and more data (engine, transmission, brakes, wind wipers etc).</p>\n\n<p>Financials</p>\n\n<p>BB is cashflow positive for the last 3 full years with more cash than debt, there is no risk of bankrupcy despite this fear for the last 5 or so years. The company it self targets a healthy gross margin of 80-85% and operating income of 20-25%. Current FCF is 1% but since they&#39;re in a growth phase I don&#39;t see that as a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Leadership</p>\n\n<p>CEO John Chen is an experienced leader with a technology background as a design engineer. He turned around Cybase from a 362 million dollar low to a 5.8B dollar in 12 years. He joined BB in 2013 and has received much praise for the turn around. He&#39;s currently signed on until atleast 2023 (hopefully until IVY is out and running) and has stock bonuses should the stock hit various levels between 16-30/share.</p>\n\n<p>Future and risks</p>\n\n<p>BB as a stock seem to have some bad press due being seen as a WSB meme stock. I&#39;m personally hoping it holds support at 11-13 for a few months and trade sideways until WSB moves on to something else so it can grow organically. There&#39;s not much news on guidance regarding IVY and it is not scheduled to release until 2023 and development costs may eat into short term numbers. Although institution ownership has increased from 49% to 65% in recent months so there optimism from big money.</p>\n\n<p>At BB&#39;s own margin goals with revenues of 2b/3b/4b would equate to net profites of 500m/750m/1b. If growth is around 20% a 40 p/e is very reasonable which gives a market cap of 20b-40b. If a revenue growth cycle hits above expectations this could be even higher. I see a price of around 5b market cap as the floor and I don&#39;t see any reason it should go lower especially as car sales recover as we move past covid.</p>\n\n<p>sources: BB investor presentation and official balance sheets.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lb92ma/blackberry_dd/","title":"Blackberry DD","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T01:30:17.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 01:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lb92ma","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lb92ma/blackberry_dd/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lb92ma/blackberry_dd/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"forshakuras","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/forshakuras","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"forshakuras","score":1137,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"黑莓DD","the_new_excerpt":"声明：我不是理财顾问，这都是我自己的观点。我持有\n~4k股的bb，并开始购买在〜4美元，整体平均成本〜12美元。\n\n有一件事，真的很烦我在这整个GME的传奇是不知何故BB成为\n一支记忆股和 \"空头挤压 \"的目标（SI是......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"黑莓DD","the_new_excerpt":"聲明：我不是理財顧問，這都是我自己的觀點。我持有\n~4k股的bb，並開始購買在〜4美元，整體平均成本〜12美元。\n\n有一件事，真的很煩我在這整個GME的傳奇是不知何故BB成爲\n一支記憶股和 \"空頭擠壓 \"的目標（SI是......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lj0gkr","excerpt":"I’m young (19).
