I have been tracking stock performance of some of the original ones posted on here and it&#39;s terrible...but if you check the website or scraper tool they have moved the goalposts, ie restarting the fund or changing the cost average. </p>\n\n<p>Frequent mentions does not equal positive gains. Ever since the GME hype, I am leery this kind of sentiment  information and the positive feedback loop of creating more mentions and more people buying is extremely valuable to parties interested in short positions. It provides nice research on stocks people will likely buy with no DD other than it was mentioned a lot. And coincidentally many of these stocks are already your classic meme stocks technically overvalued.</p>\n\n<p>I have been tracking roughly 400 tickers that have appeared on 48 hour and weekly sentiment lists and it&#39;s performance is inferior relative to index funds over that period. Of course there are some winners but I&#39;ve yet to have any top 10 or 20 list for a period outperform an index. </p>\n\n<p>Are we sure this sentiment scraping stuff isnt just playing into the exact data shorty wants? You get replies in the comments like &quot;this is genius!&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m going to make so much money&quot; and check the acct and it&#39;s often less than a month old only active in stock subs with a couple comments. </p>\n\n<p>Be careful folks. The sentiment data may identify stocks worthy of further DD, but the amount of euphoric responses to daily sentiment scraping posts worries me we have a lot of short research occurring on here disguised as help.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m6z6cj/are_we_sure_all_these_sentiment_scrapers_are_good/","title":"Are we sure all these sentiment scrapers are good?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T15:47:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 15:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m6z6cj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6z6cj/are_we_sure_all_these_sentiment_scrapers_are_good/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6z6cj/are_we_sure_all_these_sentiment_scrapers_are_good/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ThunderBobMajerle","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThunderBobMajerle","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ThunderBobMajerle","score":152,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我们确定这些情怀刮刮乐都好吗？","the_new_excerpt":"有人担心我们老是看到这些情怀数据搜刮的帖子吗？我有\n一直跟踪的股票性能的一些原始的在这里发布和\n它是可怕的......但如果你检查网站或刮刀工具，他们已经移动了。\n门柱，即重新启动基金或改变成本... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們確定這些情懷刮刮樂都好嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"有人擔心我們老是看到這些情懷數據搜刮的帖子嗎？我有\n一直跟蹤的股票性能的一些原始的在這裏發佈和\n它是可怕的......但如果你檢查網站或刮刀工具，他們已經移動了。\n門柱，即重新啓動基金或改變成本... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mls9w4","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mls9w4/morgan_stanley_dumped_5_billion_in_archegos/","title":"Morgan Stanley dumped $5 billion in Archegos’ stocks the night before massive fire sale hit rivals","date":"April 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"モルガン・スタンレーがアルケゴス社の株を50億ドルも売却したのは、ライバル社を襲った大規模なファイアーセールの前夜だった。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"摩根士丹利在大规模火爆抛售Archegos股票前夜抛售50亿美元，冲击竞争对手。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"摩根士丹利在大規模火爆拋售Archegos股票前夜拋售50億美元，衝擊競爭對手。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mlfka2","excerpt":"My only stake in the game is $XLE because I like ETFs.\n\nEVs are going to take a long time to be the main consumer form of transport IMO.\nEven if that comes faster than I expect our reliance on fossil fuels to\nliterally fuel our economy won't be going away any time soon.\n\nMore states lifting lockdown…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mlfka2/anyone_else_bullish_on_oil/","title":"Anyone else bullish on oil?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 07, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"原油に強気な人はいませんか？","the_new_excerpt":"ETFが好きなので、私の唯一の出資先はXLEドルです。\n\nEVが消費者の主要な交通手段になるには、まだまだ時間がかかると思います。\nたとえそれが私の予想より早く実現したとしても、経済の文字通りの燃料である化石燃料への依存はいつまでたっても消えません。\n文字通り経済の原動力である化石燃料への依存は、すぐにはなくならないでしょう。\n\nより多くの州がロックダウンを解除...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"还有人看好石油吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我在游戏中的唯一股份是$XLE，因为我喜欢ETFs。\n\n电动车要成为主要的消费型交通工具还需要很长的时间，我认为。\n即使这比我预期的我们对化石燃料的依赖来得更快。\n从字面上看，我们的经济燃料不会很快消失。\n\n更多的州解除封锁...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"還有人看好石油嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我在遊戲中的唯一股份是$XLE，因爲我喜歡ETFs。\n\n電動車要成爲主要的消費型交通工具還需要很長的時間，我認爲。\n即使這比我預期的我們對化石燃料的依賴來得更快。\n從字面上看，我們的經濟燃料不會很快消失。\n\n更多的州解除封鎖...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m6z6cj","previousId":"RedditPost-mls9w4","nextId":"RedditPost-mlfka2","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m6z6cj/are_we_sure_all_these_sentiment_scrapers_are_good/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
