It’s down 12% from late November highs.</p>\n\n<p>But for a name like Costco, a 12% move is rather significant. It’s not just significant – it’s a buying opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Costco did take a modest hit during the pandemic, in part due to store closures. For instance, in April same-store sales excluding gasoline and foreign currency effects were flat. That’s a huge disappointment by Costco’s high standards.</p>\n\n<p>But as stores reopened, Costco immediately got back on track. In June, for instance, same-store sales rose 14% on the same basis. For the third quarter (ending May 10), Costco drove 4.8% same-store growth. In Q4, the figure accelerated to better than 11%. Growth in December and January averaged better than 8%.</p>\n\n<p>There’s not much in the numbers to suggest anything has changed. The pandemic caused a bit of volatility, yes, but Costco still grew adjusted same-store sales 9% in FY2020 and 6% the year before.\nAs far as e-commerce goes, the pandemic has given Costco a chance to build out its own business. E-commerce revenue grew 50% in FY2020 and climbed another 18% through the first 22 weeks of FY2021.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that Costco’s profit comes largely from membership fees. In FY2020, for instance, membership fees were about 65% of operating profit. which was actually down from 71% the year before. Essentially, Costco turns about 1% of its sales into operating profit, then tacks on membership revenue.</p>\n\n<p>That membership revenue is benefiting from customers acquired last year. Most are going to stick around for the long haul. The boost here isn’t like that of, say, a grocery store, whose sales will return to pre-pandemic levels as normalcy returns.</p>\n\n<p>Remember also that membership revenue is part of why COST stock is expensive – and has been for years. Yes, this is a fantastically well-run company. But the model’s reliance on membership fees creates faster growth as well.</p>\n\n<p>An extra dollar in membership fees drops to the operating profit line at huge margins. And so Costco can grow earnings faster than most any other brick-and-mortar retailer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lvtb61/costco_stock_is_an_easy_buy_on_the_dip_cost_stock/","title":"Costco Stock Is an Easy Buy on the Dip COST stock is one of the best in the market – and it's now on sale","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T06:44:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 06:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvtb61","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lvtb61/costco_stock_is_an_easy_buy_on_the_dip_cost_stock/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lvtb61/costco_stock_is_an_easy_buy_on_the_dip_cost_stock/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"DangerStranger138","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DangerStranger138","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DangerStranger138","score":4059,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"好市多股票是一个简单的购买在Dip COST股票是市场上最好的之一 - 它现在打折","the_new_excerpt":"Costco股票是一个轻松的买入在Dip COST股票是一个最好的在\n市场--现在正在销售\n[https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2021/03/cost-stock-costco-easy-buy-on-the-dip/]\n\n2021年至今，COST股价跌幅超过9%。从11月底开始下跌了12%。\n高。\n\n但是，对于一个名字像...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"好市多股票是一個簡單的購買在Dip COST股票是市場上最好的之一 - 它現在打折","the_new_excerpt":"Costco股票是一個輕鬆的買入在Dip COST股票是一個最好的在\n市場--現在正在銷售\n[https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2021/03/cost-stock-costco-easy-buy-on-the-dip/]\n\n2021年至今，COST股價跌幅超過9%。從11月底開始下跌了12%。\n高。\n\n但是，對於一個名字像...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m6prny","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6prny/sorry_im_late_to_the_party_but_wsb_has_now/","title":"Sorry I'm late to the party, but WSB has now adopted a sloth","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对不起，我迟到了，但WSB现在已经采用了一个树懒","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"對不起，我遲到了，但WSB現在已經採用了一個樹懶","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m6x9l0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6x9l0/me_and_the_boys_now_that_stimmy_day_is_here/","title":"Me and the boys now that stimmy day is here","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 17, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我和孩子们的刺激日到了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我和孩子們的刺激日到了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lvtb61","previousId":"RedditPost-m6prny","nextId":"RedditPost-m6x9l0","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lvtb61/costco_stock_is_an_easy_buy_on_the_dip_cost_stock/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
