Just wondering what you have bought with the dip or sold, hopefully not. I added more DIS, CRSR, and OPEN; and got into NIO and PINS. I had been wanting to add NIO for a while to get some EV plays and was waiting for the right moment. I know the journey ahead will be long and volatile, but I plan on hold for 5-7 years. Added CRSR because I use their products and am a big fan, also have been seeing them mentioned a lot. </p>\n\n<p>DIS is doing great and has a bright future ahead because of Disney+. As Disney+ becomes more available internationally it will be a huge rival to Netflix. They also have great originals. </p>\n\n<p>I was looking into LMND but I don’t have that strong of a conviction on them, and most comments I have seen on Reddit have been against.
