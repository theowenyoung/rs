I invested 6k into various stocks on Robinhood. I decided to take my money out of Robinhood because all the negative news and concern of a lawsuit. Plus, I think it may have been time to find something a little more advanced than Robinhood. I ended up selling at a good time and got a total profit of about 3k. I do not claim to be good at investing as I am still learning, but my question is what brokerage should I use. I have a vanguard account but that is mainly just for my ROTH IRA and ETFs in the normal brokerage. I want something that is good for individual stocks and has tools and research on those. I have a WeBull account but I am not sure I want to use that because its not owned by a USA company, not sure if that matters that much though. I was looking at M1 Finance. My mom has a TD Ameritrade so she let me look around on that a bit. I just want something that is user-friendly but also has the tools for individual stocks. Any suggestions?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lup5sf/got_rid_of_robinhood_what_should_i_use_next/","title":"Got rid of Robinhood.
