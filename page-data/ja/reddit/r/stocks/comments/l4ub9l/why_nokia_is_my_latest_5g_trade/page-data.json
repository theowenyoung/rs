(NOK)</strong> stock in 2020 may seem like the most obvious investment anyone could have ever made. But in the here and now, the stock seems like nothing more than a perpetual loser… a stock market has-been.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last two decades, Nokia has invested a staggering $150 billion to develop advanced telecommunications technologies, including more than $5 billion last year alone. As a result of these R&amp;D investments, the company has secured a leading share of essential patents for GSM, 3G, 4G, and 5G technologies. <strong>They have OVER 3000 patents relating to 5G.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This “secret weapon” attracts little attention from investors: this lucrative and growing patent portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>This portfolio throws off more than $1.5 billion a year in licensing revenue. Because most of that revenue flows directly to the bottom line as net profit, it provides Nokia with steady, robust cash flow.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, this source of income is so substantial that it has totaled <em>more than twice the entire company’s income</em> during the last six years.</p>\n\n<p>Despite Nokia’s considerable corporate achievements, the company has failed to convert its strengths into strong long-term revenue and profit growth. To the contrary, the company has been a “serial disappointer” for many years. <strong>The 5G era has arrived, and Nokia is prepared for it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Too capitalize on the opportunity Nokia stock is providing, I purchased a 2023 7 Call, 5 Call, 4 Call, and am loaded up in regular shares.
