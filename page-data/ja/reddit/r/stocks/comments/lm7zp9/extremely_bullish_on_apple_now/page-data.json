Apple has some of the highest margins (seem to be only increasing), insane revenue (they are still growing), good moat (its a hardware company basically), immune to monopoly regulation (they only control like what? 6% of the entire smartphone market?), great marketing, and have a lot of vertical integration (iMessage, Apple m1, iCloud, Apple Card, Apple one, etc). They also have shit ton of cash (they can buy Netflix full on the spot basically), and assets (their headquarters is roughly worth around $5B for example). Lastly, they have a lot of room to grow because they are so far from a monopoly, and they going into other areas where they can dominate (Apple Car, Apple card, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade+). </p>\n\n<p>Here are the other areas they dominate: Apple iPad, and Apple Watch. Nothing comes close to competitors. </p>\n\n<p>The only area where I can see apple failing is if they just keep riding the wave, and get lazy with their product innovations (you can argue this is already happening). However, after the latest apple chip, and the amount of cash they have, they got to be failing a lot and for a long time for Apple to be in any bad spot. Hence, it&#39;s a safe bet in my eyes with a decent amount of upside. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I like the stock. A lot.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lm7zp9/extremely_bullish_on_apple_now/","title":"Extremely bullish on apple now","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-18T02:26:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-18 02:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lm7zp9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lm7zp9/extremely_bullish_on_apple_now/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lm7zp9/extremely_bullish_on_apple_now/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"maxadorable","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/maxadorable","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"maxadorable","score":309,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"现在极度看好苹果","the_new_excerpt":"看完这个。\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-09/this-is-how-tim-cook-transformed-apple-aapl-after-steve-jobs\n\n\n\n我开始意识到苹果管理团队有多好，蒂姆-库克有多好。\n在政治方面导航空间。苹果拥有一些最高的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"現在極度看好蘋果","the_new_excerpt":"看完這個。\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-09/this-is-how-tim-cook-transformed-apple-aapl-after-steve-jobs\n\n\n\n我開始意識到蘋果管理團隊有多好，蒂姆-庫克有多好。\n在政治方面導航空間。蘋果擁有一些最高的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lx20bm","excerpt":"Wall Street analyst is bullish on the stock of the Coinbase exchange ahead of\nits public debut.\n\nGil Luria of DA Davidson has given COIN its first \"buy\" rating, building on the\ngrowing momentum behind the company.\n\nThe analyst writes that the cryptocurrency industry is going to have its own\n\"Amazon…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lx20bm/wall_street_analyst_gives_coinbase_stock_its/","title":"Wall Street Analyst Gives Coinbase Stock Its First Rating Ahead of Public Debut","date":"March 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"华尔街分析师在上市前给予Coinbase股票首次评级","the_new_excerpt":"华尔街分析师看好Coinbase交易所的股价前\n其首次公开亮相。\n\nDA Davidson公司的Gil Luria首次给予COIN \"买入 \"评级，建立在。\n公司背后不断增长的动力。\n\n该分析师写道，加密货币行业将有自己的?\n\"亚马逊...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"華爾街分析師在上市前給予Coinbase股票首次評級","the_new_excerpt":"華爾街分析師看好Coinbase交易所的股價前\n其首次公開亮相。\n\nDA Davidson公司的Gil Luria首次給予COIN \"買入 \"評級，建立在。\n公司背後不斷增長的動力。\n\n該分析師寫道，加密貨幣行業將有自己的?\n\"亞馬遜...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lwta3q","excerpt":"I've been a longtime lurker in this sub, even before I grew a pair and started\ndipping my toes into the market.
