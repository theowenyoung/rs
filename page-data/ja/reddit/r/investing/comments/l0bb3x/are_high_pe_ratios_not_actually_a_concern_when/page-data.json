Earnings are temporarily down due to covid, which results in a higher ratio, but assuming the economy opens up after enough people have been vaccinated, earnings should go way up as people stop saving and start spending. Savings rates are at an all time high, but I think we all know that will end once things open up again. Most consumers who have saved more in the past year will be eager to spend more once they&#39;re comfortable doing so. Isn&#39;t it safe to assume earnings will go up when savings rates drop?</p>\n\n<p>The S&amp;P&#39;s highest P/E Ratio occurred in early 2009, which was literally the best time to buy stocks in our lifetimes thus far.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l0bb3x/are_high_pe_ratios_not_actually_a_concern_when/","title":"Are high P/E Ratios not actually a concern when earnings are only down temporarily?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-19T22:17:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-19 22:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l0bb3x","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l0bb3x/are_high_pe_ratios_not_actually_a_concern_when/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l0bb3x/are_high_pe_ratios_not_actually_a_concern_when/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"NastyNas0","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NastyNas0","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"NastyNas0","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"当盈利只是暂时下降时，高市盈率其实并不值得担心吗？","the_new_excerpt":"很多人都在关注市场的高市盈率，但我不觉得\n这是关注，因为它似乎。盈利暂时下降，因为科维德。\n导致比率较高，但假设经济开放后有足够的\n人们接种了疫苗，收入应该会大幅增加，因为人们... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"當盈利只是暫時下降時，高市盈率其實並不值得擔心嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"很多人都在關注市場的高市盈率，但我不覺得\n這是關注，因爲它似乎。盈利暫時下降，因爲科維德。\n導致比率較高，但假設經濟開放後有足夠的\n人們接種了疫苗，收入應該會大幅增加，因爲人們... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l9evvg","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9evvg/im_26_and_i_like_this_stock/","title":"I'm 26 and I like this stock","date":"February 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我26岁，我喜欢这只股票","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我26歲，我喜歡這隻股票","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l9ozuk","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ozuk/uthechalkingdad_with_is_chalk_art/","title":"u/Thechalkingdad with is chalk art","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 01, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"u/Thechalkingdad与是粉笔艺术。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"u/Thechalkingdad與是粉筆藝術。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l0bb3x","previousId":"RedditPost-l9evvg","nextId":"RedditPost-l9ozuk","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l0bb3x/are_high_pe_ratios_not_actually_a_concern_when/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
