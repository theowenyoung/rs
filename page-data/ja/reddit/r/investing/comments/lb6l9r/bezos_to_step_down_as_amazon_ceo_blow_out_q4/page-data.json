We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime’s insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. “If you do it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. That yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive. When you look at our financial results, what you’re actually seeing are the long-run cumulative results of invention. Right now I see Amazon at its most inventive ever, making it an optimal time for this transition.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-reports-4q-2020-earnings-results-152012181.html\">Source</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lb6l9r/bezos_to_step_down_as_amazon_ceo_blow_out_q4/","title":"Bezos to step down as Amazon CEO - Blow out Q4","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T23:33:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 23:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lb6l9r","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb6l9r/bezos_to_step_down_as_amazon_ceo_blow_out_q4/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb6l9r/bezos_to_step_down_as_amazon_ceo_blow_out_q4/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Avaronah","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Avaronah","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Avaronah","score":5478,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"贝佐斯将卸任亚马逊CEO--吹响Q4的号角","the_new_excerpt":"嗯，这是意料之外的。不过他们确实有一个井喷的季度。\n\n第四季度销售额首次突破1000亿美元：1255.6亿美元，而预期为1197.0亿美元，同比为874.4亿美元。\n亿元，预期1197.0亿元，同比874.4亿元。\n\nEPS：14.09美元，预期7.34美元--这也太疯狂了。\n\n我需要一天的时间来理解这个。什么...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"貝佐斯將卸任亞馬遜CEO--吹響Q4的號角","the_new_excerpt":"嗯，這是意料之外的。不過他們確實有一個井噴的季度。\n\n第四季度銷售額首次突破1000億美元：1255.6億美元，而預期爲1197.0億美元，同比爲874.4億美元。\n億元，預期1197.0億元，同比874.4億元。\n\nEPS：14.09美元，預期7.34美元--這也太瘋狂了。\n\n我需要一天的時間來理解這個。什麼...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lj8gh1","excerpt":"Well, as I predicted, they kept the price over $50 so that the stack of 10,000\n(yes, ten thousand options) Put contracts didn't get executed.
