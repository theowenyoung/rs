But for savers with straightforward finances, the Vanguard service could be ample.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the first time Vanguard has thrown down the gauntlet to the financial industry with rock-bottom prices.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017, it launched an online investment service costing just 0.15 per cent a year – considerably cheaper than the incumbents.</p>\n\n<p>And last year it added a self-invested personal pension charging 0.15 per cent a year – capped at £375. By comparison, wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown charges up to 0.45 per cent a year.</p>\n\n<p>Vanguard hopes its new &#39;personal financial planning&#39; service will appeal especially to people coming up to retirement and who want to turn savings into a secure income for their old age.</p>\n\n<p>It will offer advice on how to achieve retirement targets by exploring a range of tax-efficient options. This will be particularly important for savers who risk breaching the pension saving lifetime allowance of £1,073,100.</p>\n\n<p>Any money above this level taken as income incurs an extra 25 per cent charge and taken as a lump sum is taxed at 55 per cent.</p>\n\n<p>Hagerty says: &#39;We see the lifetime allowance as something that could become a factor for many people – and we aim to provide support so clients are able to consider other tax-efficient options, such as individual savings accounts.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Initially the service will only be open to people with at least £50,000 to invest and this money will have to be put into Vanguard&#39;s range of funds.</p>\n\n<p>Those with savings of £50,000 to £100,000 will be offered a &#39;digital financial planning experience&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>They will also be able to talk through the details and their aims with an adviser over the phone.</p>\n\n<p>Savers with more than £100,000 can have video-based conversations as well as accessing phone support.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile those with more than £750,000 invested will get their own financial planner, who will also be able to offer face-to-face financial advice.</p>\n\n<p>Hagerty says: &#39;Financial advice will be offered by real people – not robots. But once advisers have discussed retirement targets with clients, they will use technology to help manage a portfolio.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Vanguard will use back office technology to set off alerts when it is time for a customer to move their money into different accounts or receive fresh advice. </p>\n\n<p>These alerts will be triggered at points that customers have agreed in advance with advisers. They could include, for example, when a customer hits an investment goal, or needs to change the level of risk of their investments as they move closer to retirement.</p>\n\n<p>Advice will not cover non-Vanguard-branded investments, though these could still be taken into account when coming up with a financial plan.</p>\n\n<p>Vanguard offers more than 75 funds to choose from, which track indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 100.</p>\n\n<p>Hagerty says Vanguard is not trying to take money from independent financial advisers, as they play a vital role in the market.</p>\n\n<p>Yet these advisers might still have plenty to fear – with Vanguard calculating that its low-cost model means an investor with a £250,000 lump sum could save more than £190,000 over 25 years if they pay 0.79 per cent a year in total charges for fund management and advice rather than 2.4 per cent of their investment upfront and 1.9 per cent a year thereafter. This is based on a projected return of 5 per cent a year.</p>\n\n<p>Hagerty adds: &#39;With potential savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds, you may ask yourself whether paying for expensive managed funds and financial advice offers value for money.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Most independent financial advisers charge an annual fee calculated as a percentage of your investments, but some charge an hourly rate, generally about £150 an hour.</p>\n\n<p>New player Bancroft Wealth offers financial advice for a competitive flat fee of £500 a year.</p>\n\n<p>Jeremy Fawcett, founder of the consultancy Platforum, believes the new Vanguard service could steal customers from existing so-called robo-adviser services, such as Nutmeg, as well as DIY investment broker services that offer advice arms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity.</p>\n\n<p>Nutmeg charges 0.99 per cent a year for managing funds, but requires a one-off £575 for &#39;personalised planning and advice&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Hargreaves Lansdown charges an initial 1 per cent for &#39;investment advice&#39; on the first £1 million you have with it, with a minimum charge of £495 if you receive advice by phone.</p>\n\n<p>Ongoing financial advice costs 0.365 per cent a year. The fees are separate from any fund charges.</p>\n\n<p>Fidelity offers a &#39;Wealth Management&#39; investment advice service charging 1 per cent of the amount to be managed and 0.5 per cent a year for a review. This levy is separate from any fund charges.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mtjvlt/vanguard_to_launch_uk_personal_financial_planning/","title":"Vanguard to launch UK Personal Financial Planning","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"April 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-18T20:53:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-18 20:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mtjvlt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mtjvlt/vanguard_to_launch_uk_personal_financial_planning/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mtjvlt/vanguard_to_launch_uk_personal_financial_planning/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"LandauCalrisian","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LandauCalrisian","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"LandauCalrisian","score":457,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"バンガード社が英国でパーソナル・ファイナンシャル・プランニングを開始","the_new_excerpt":"バンガード社がファイナンシャル・アドバイスの価格を引き下げ\n[https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-9482093/Vanguard-slashes-price-financial-advice.html]\n\n米国の投資大手バンガード社は、明日から低価格のサービスを開始し、ファイナンシャル・アドバイス市場を揺るがすことを目指している。\n明日から低価格のサービスを開始します。\n\nバンガード社は、これまでにも多くの金融商品を提供してきました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Vanguard将推出英国个人理财规划","the_new_excerpt":"Vanguard削减理财咨询的价格。\n[https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-9482093/Vanguard-slashes-price-financial-advice.html]\n\n美国投资巨头Vanguard旨在撼动金融咨询市场，以\n明天推出的降价服务。\n\n已经以...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Vanguard將推出英國個人理財規劃","the_new_excerpt":"Vanguard削減理財諮詢的價格。\n[https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-9482093/Vanguard-slashes-price-financial-advice.html]\n\n美國投資巨頭Vanguard旨在撼動金融諮詢市場，以\n明天推出的降價服務。\n\n已經以...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1383634601063510019","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1383634601063510019","title":"Saturday night crypto crashes are when you typically see a flight to the safety of dogecoin","date":"April 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"土曜の夜の暗号の暴落は、通常、dogecoinの安全性への逃避が見られるときです。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"周六晚上加密崩溃的时候，你通常会看到一个飞往安全的dogecoin。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"週六晚上加密崩潰的時候，你通常會看到一個飛往安全的dogecoin。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mtlkh9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtlkh9/where_were_going_we_dont_need_roads/","title":"Where we're going, we don't need roads.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 18, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"私たちが行くところには、道路は必要ありません。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们要去的地方，我们不需要道路。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們要去的地方，我們不需要道路。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mtjvlt","previousId":"TweetPost-1383634601063510019","nextId":"RedditPost-mtlkh9","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mtjvlt/vanguard_to_launch_uk_personal_financial_planning/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
