I pick the second.</p>\n\n<p>Doordash, like every other food delivery, is still losing money.  This is important because the pandemic is &quot;as good as it gets&quot; for Doordash--there will never be another time with so many people &quot;forced&quot; into ordering delivered food.  Yet with all these factors lining up beyond their wildest dreams, Doordash is still unprofitable.  How unprofitable?</p>\n\n<p>4th quarter 2020: net loss of $2.67 per share.<br/>\nCompared to $3.05 loss per share in Q4 2019.<br/>\nThat&#39;s a gain of 12.5%.  Worldwide pandemic with people holed up in their houses, doordash only ups by 12.5%.  Not bullish.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Lockup expiration:</strong><br/>\nDoordash float is 144M.<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doordash-discloses-early-expiration-of-lockup-agreements-on-about-114-million-shares-2021-03-01\">Doordash stock lockup expires 3/9, making 110M shares available.</a>  </p>\n\n<p>The stock has basically &quot;peaked&quot;.  Won&#39;t there be a massive selloff in the coming weeks?  <strong>It seems rational to me,</strong> that DDash insiders know the stock has peaked, and will want to get rid of shares while the going is good.  </p>\n\n<p>However, the short interest is only 5.4%.  I would expect a much higher short if it were really going to tank.  For comparison, GRUB shortint is a whopping 20%.
