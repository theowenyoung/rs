We need to talk about shipping:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>For anyone who hasn&#39;t looked at a maritime shipping/bulker/tanker company:  A) Good choice! B) The value of these companies is almost all assets.  This is one of the few places you&#39;ll still see companies trade at/below book value.  Star Bulker Carriers, for example, has $2.9 billion in ships, $1.5 billion in net equity, and a $1.2 Billion market cap.  Frontline has $1.5 Billion in equity, $1.3 billion market cap.  That doesn&#39;t mean you should go out and buy $SBLK or $FRO.  The business is an asset heavy, miserably unprofitable commodity service.  Everyone in the shipping industry waits around cutting their teeth until a shipping supercycle hits and they can actually profit.  They have extreme sensitivity to interest rates, and extreme sensitivity to economic downturns.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>You aren&#39;t getting $1 for $.90 buying these stocks.  You&#39;re getting the expected future cashflows from $1 of net merchant ship, which the market ascribes an NPV of  &gt;$1.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I digress.  Castor, as of 9/30, has $30 million in ships.  Six 75,000 DWT bulkers, to be exact.  A tiny fleet. They&#39;ve now bought a Capesize and 2 LR2 tankers.  Lets call that an extra $80 million.  $110MM in ships.  Their market cap, as of close, is $880MM.  8x price/assets for merchant ships!  WHAT?  It&#39;s not uncommon for this company&#39;s peers to trade at .3x price/assets!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s... a bad investment.  Quite possibly the worst investment opportunity I&#39;ve ever seen.  At least most bubbles have some &quot;moonshot&quot; potential; these guys buy boats.  Sell.  Run.  This is the dumbest bubble I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TLDR:  This is the top, lads.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/li4uaz/castor_maritime_ctrm_to_buy_two_lr2_tankers_for/","title":"Castor Maritime ($CTRM) to buy two LR2 tankers for $27MM.
