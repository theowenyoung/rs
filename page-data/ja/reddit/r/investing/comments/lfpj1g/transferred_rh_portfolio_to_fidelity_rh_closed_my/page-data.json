My TDA portfolio transferred without issue. However, I had bought a couple of stocks on margin on RH prior to initiating the portfolio transfer. 2 of my 4 stocks on RH transferred to Fidelity and two remained behind in my RH account. I have received a notification from Fidelity that I have a margin debt that needs to be settle or they&#39;ll liquidate my positions to satisfy the margin debt.   </p>\n\n<p>I initiated another transfer to get the remaining stocks and cash balance from RH this morning and within an hour or two, RH had closed my positions and deactivated my account. The closed positions were converted to cash and added to my cash balance. I can withdraw some of my cash balance in my RH account to my bank account. But there&#39;s still some money that is not available to withdraw for some reason.   </p>\n\n<p>What am I supposed to do?
