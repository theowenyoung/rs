My goal is 60k for a downpayment. I currently have about 30k (16k in an RH account and 14k in savings) and am saving around ~1800 a month. This does not include my 6 month emergency savings.</p>\n\n<p>In November I took $4500 and opened an <del>IRA</del> broker account with RH as my &quot;gambling&quot; account. It was money that I wanted to learn with and could afford to lose. I figured any extra earnings would go towards my house fund. That $4500 is now $16000 (everyones a genius in a bull market). So $4500 was money I could afford to lose but $16000 isn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure what to do from here. The options I&#39;m considering:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Pull out the 10k and put it in a savings account with my other 14k. I heard that you shouldn&#39;t invest money you plan on using within a year. It might take a little longer than a year for me to buy a house though.</li>\n<li>Invest the 10k into an index fund and keep the other 4.5k in high risk stocks like my original setup.</li>\n<li>Take 5k into savings and keep the other 5k in the account to invest in stocks/index funds</li>\n<li>Let it ride (JK, not doing this)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I&#39;m currently 30 years old if that makes a difference. Any advice would be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Just realized IRA was not the term I should&#39;ve been using. It&#39;s a regular, not tax advantaged broker account with robinhood.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lfhey8/not_sure_what_to_do_with_my_savings_while_i_save/","title":"Not sure what to do with my savings while I save for a house","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T02:02:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 02:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfhey8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfhey8/not_sure_what_to_do_with_my_savings_while_i_save/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfhey8/not_sure_what_to_do_with_my_savings_while_i_save/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"theNeumannArchitect","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theNeumannArchitect","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"theNeumannArchitect","score":108,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"不知道攒钱买房的时候，我的积蓄该怎么办？","the_new_excerpt":"你好，我目前正在攒钱买房。我的目标是6万的首付。\n我目前有3万左右（RH账户1.6万，储蓄1.4万），我是。\n每月节省约1800元。这还不包括我6个月的应急储蓄。\n\n11月，我拿了4500元，开了一个IRA经纪人账户... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不知道攢錢買房的時候，我的積蓄該怎麼辦？","the_new_excerpt":"你好，我目前正在攢錢買房。我的目標是6萬的首付。\n我目前有3萬左右（RH賬戶1.6萬，儲蓄1.4萬），我是。\n每月節省約1800元。這還不包括我6個月的應急儲蓄。\n\n11月，我拿了4500元，開了一個IRA經紀人賬戶... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1364044392152072192","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1364044392152072192","title":"When Josh goes on a heater there is no one better at blogging than him\n\nVintage Reformed Broker here\n\nhttps://t.co/uOZOuEY3NL https://t.co/exBB8qIlJf","date":"February 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"当Josh开始发热的时候，没有人比他更擅长写博客了。\n\n复古的改革派经纪人在这里\n\nhttps://t.co/uOZOuEY3NL","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"當Josh開始發熱的時候，沒有人比他更擅長寫博客了。\n\n復古的改革派經紀人在這裏\n\nhttps://t.co/uOZOuEY3NL","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lq4ckx","excerpt":"I bought Tesla during the dip in March because of Covid and have been holding\nsince.
