The higher the number, the more expensive the stock is compared to sales.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What about P/E ratio?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Price / Earnings ratio is great for mature companies, but the hottest stocks typically lose money, so P/S is a quick and lazy proxy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Got an example?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Take AAPL&#39;s Market Cap of $2113B and TTM sales of $294B. 2113/294=7. So the P/S ratio of AAPL is 7. Is that good or bad? Well it depends on the industry. Typically Apple has a PS ratio of 2-5. APPL had a PS ratio of 7 at the end of 2007, and we all know what happened in 2008, right?</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does the P/S ratio have to do with anything?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are currently <a href=\"https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&amp;o=-ps&amp;r=41\">54 stocks with a PS over 30</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The stocks with the highest P/S ratio <a href=\"https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=141&amp;f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&amp;o=-ps\">are getting hit the hardest</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is having a PS ratio over 30 bad?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Historically, anything with a P/S over 30 underperforms as an investment. The revenue growth will outperform, but the overall stock still underperforms, because all that revenue growth was already priced in.  None of the FANG stocks ever exceeded a P/S ratio of 25. MSFT had a PS ratio of about 28 back in 1999, and it took 17 years for the price to recover. </p>\n\n<p><strong>When was the last time we had this many stocks with a P/S over 30?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>At the end of 1999 we had 22, making up 6.70% of US market cap. From 2001-2019 we had very few. At the end of 2020 we had 50, making up 4.80% of US market cap. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How significant is this?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know, man. 5% of the market is not significant. Also, there isn&#39;t a lot of data, only 31 stocks went over a P/S ratio of 30 from 2001-2019 (the other 85 instances occurred in 2000 &amp; 2020.)  Also it&#39;s worth noting the valuation of all stocks <a href=\"https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales\">has been trending up</a> because of low rates. Yay?</p>\n\n<p><strong>What should you do?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know, man. I am not a broker/ dealer. This is not advice. You can quickly check your individual stocks P/S ratio on <a href=\"https://finviz.com/\">finviz</a>. P/S over 10 is red, which means you should dig deeper.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lqqoks/watch_your_ps_ratio_ps_over_30_is_incredibly_risky/","title":"Watch your P/S Ratio.
