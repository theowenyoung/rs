I normally contribute the max to the Roth IRA account, and made the regular account a few years to invest more of my income since the IRAs have a limit.</p>\n\n<p>I recently saw someone actively trade stocks using their IRA account, so I did some reading and searching, and it seems the suggestion is to have long term investment in regular accounts (e.g stable ETFs: VTI, etc), and have more volatile investments in the Roth account, e.g (ARKs, individual stocks, etc).</p>\n\n<p>The reasoning for long term investments in the regular taxable account is because you won&#39;t be cashing in anytime soon, so it&#39;s better there. Whereas with individual stocks, volatile ETFs, you&#39;re more likely to buy/sell, so it&#39;s better if they&#39;re in the IRA accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say my portfolio are as following hypothetically:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>VTI</p></li>\n<li><p>ARKG</p></li>\n<li><p>ICLN</p></li>\n<li><p>DKNG</p></li>\n<li><p>PLTR and so on...</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Should I move my assets around so the taxable brokerage account has:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>VTI</p></li>\n<li><p>ICLN</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Whereas the IRA account would have the remaining that I&#39;m more likely to buy/sell often? The downside to actively trading in the IRA account is the contributions cannot be recovered if loss, e.g I lose 500 of the 6000, I cannot put 500 back in for that year.</p>\n\n<p>Or am I just over complicating things?
