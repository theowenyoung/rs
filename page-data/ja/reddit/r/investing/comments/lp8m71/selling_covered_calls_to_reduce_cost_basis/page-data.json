Would it behoove the individual to sell covered calls, or is there another strategy besides averaging down to reduce cost basis?</p>\n\n<p>Theoretically how low can you reduce your cost basis by selling covered calls?   If you sold weeklys and reduced your cost basis by .20 a week, is it possible to reduce your cost basis far beyond the current selling price; provided it trades side ways for an extended period of time?</p>\n\n<p>Would a better strategy be to average down as much as one could first and then sell covered calls?  </p>\n\n<p>I’m intrigued by these strategies that basically look like outright arbitrage. Ive been watching a lot of videos on the subject and have been curious as to how other individuals use this and other options strategies to accrue passive income, reduce cost basis, or any other advantages of options.</p>\n\n<p>I really hope this is a long enough post to not get deleted.  I haven’t found the answer I’m looking for on any videos or websites.  That or I’m overlooking the answer and just need clarification.
