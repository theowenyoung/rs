The purchase could help drive people to use Uber’s app more often.</p>\n\n<p>Uber Eats has been a key segment to Uber’s business amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which has dramatically reduced the number of people leaving their homes.</p>\n\n<p>“During this time our delivery business as been growing at extraordinary rates,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC on Tuesday. Drizly said it had more than 300% growth in the past year.</p>\n\n<p>The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2021. Uber said that it anticipates that more than 90% of the consideration to be paid to Drizly shareholders will consist of shares of Uber common stock, and the balance will be paid in cash.</p>\n\n<p>Uber stock was up more than 7% in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>Uber has focused its acquisition efforts on its Eats segment during the coronavirus pandemic. After talks failed to acquire food delivery service GrubHub, Uber acquired Postmates last July.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Uber has offloaded some of its more cost-eating transportation segments. The company last May transferred its electric bike and scooter business, Jump, to Lime. Uber also sold its self-driving unit, Advanced Technologies Group, to its start-up competitor Aurora Innovation on December 7, valuing ATG at approximately $4 billion at the time. Just a day later, it announced it was selling its flying taxi business, called Uber Elevate.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/uber-agrees-to-buy-alcohol-delivery-service-drizly-for-1point1-billion.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/uber-agrees-to-buy-alcohol-delivery-service-drizly-for-1point1-billion.html</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lazhet/uber_agrees_to_buy_alcohol_delivery_service/","title":"Uber agrees to buy alcohol delivery service Drizly for $1.1 billion","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T18:03:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 18:03","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lazhet","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lazhet/uber_agrees_to_buy_alcohol_delivery_service/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lazhet/uber_agrees_to_buy_alcohol_delivery_service/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"illestMFKAalive","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/illestMFKAalive","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"illestMFKAalive","score":747,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Uber同意以11亿美元收购酒类配送服务Drizly。","the_new_excerpt":"Uber周二宣布以11亿美元的股票和现金收购酒类配送服务Drizly。\n亿美元的股票和现金。\n\n交易完成后，Drizly的市场将被\n与Uber Eats应用集成。该公司将保留独立的Drizly\n应用以及，它说。\n\n成立于2012年，。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Uber同意以11億美元收購酒類配送服務Drizly。","the_new_excerpt":"Uber週二宣佈以11億美元的股票和現金收購酒類配送服務Drizly。\n億美元的股票和現金。\n\n交易完成後，Drizly的市場將被\n與Uber Eats應用集成。該公司將保留獨立的Drizly\n應用以及，它說。\n\n成立於2012年，。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lisah9","excerpt":"I just received an email from Robinhood saying the following : Hi Felix, A\nwithdrawal restriction has been placed on your brokerage account.
