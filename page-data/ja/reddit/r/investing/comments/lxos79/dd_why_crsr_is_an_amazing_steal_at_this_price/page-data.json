Gamer and creator peripherals segment net revenue was $191.8 million, an increase of 104.0% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $364.5 million, an increase of 56.8% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Gross profit was $153.8 million, an increase of 118.3% year-over-year, with gross margin of 27.6%, an improvement of 600 basis points year-over-year. Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $68.9 million, an increase of 197.7% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $84.9 million, an increase of 79.5% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Operating income was $58.9 million, an increase of 314.2% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Adjusted operating income was $71.0 million, an increase of 166.9% year-over-year.</li>\n<li>Net income was $43.0 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.0 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.08 per diluted share. _ Net revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 55.2% year-over-year. Gamer and creator peripherals segment net revenue was $539.4 million, an increase of 83.4% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $1,163.0 million, an increase of 44.8% year-over-year.\n-Gross profit was $465.4 million, an increase of 107.5% year-over-year, with gross margin of 27.3%, an improvement of 690 basis points year-over-year. Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $189.7 million, an increase of 133.2% year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $275.7 million, an increase of 92.9% year-over-year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They are expecting nearly $2 billion in revenue for 2021. And the current market cap is $3 billion.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of the CHEAPEST valuation for a company with this kind of growth. A quick comparison with AMD will reveal 10 times expected revenue in 2021 versus CRSR&#39;s 2 times in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>With yearly revenue being up 58%, there&#39;s a lot of reasons why this stock is amazing. So it begs the questions:</p>\n\n<p>If the stock is amazing, both from a growth perspective and a book value perspective, why is it going down?</p>\n\n<p>You guessed it - short sellers</p>\n\n<p><strong>SHORT INTERESTS</strong></p>\n\n<p>CRSR has one of the HIGHEST short interests in the market (on top of the other wonderful stocks mentioned in this subreddit). The S/I from january to february increased a whopping +63.8% (see <a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/short-interest/\">https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/short-interest/</a>) to 5+million shares from 3 million.</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of reasons why this might be. But If I had to guess, it&#39;s because the shorts saw an easy way to manipulate the price down whilst there&#39;s no news going on. With all the other hype going on with other tickers, they saw CRSR as an easy target as earnings is a few months away and it&#39;s not currently a big news stock</p>\n\n<p>The stock is currently trading at $33 at the time of writing, way down from its $47 high DESPITE having killer earnings and guidance. Most analyst have their price target at an average of $49 (See here: <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crsr/forecast\">https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/crsr/forecast</a>)</p>\n\n<p><strong>This leads to one of the biggest opportunities I can think of, both for a short squeeze and a buying opportunity for an excellent company at this price point.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/short-interest/\">https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/short-interest/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/crsr\">https://fintel.io/so/us/crsr</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://theenterpriseleader.com/2021/02/19/brokerages-anticipate-corsair-gaming-inc-nasdaqcrsr-will-announce-quarterly-sales-of-444-82-million.html\">https://theenterpriseleader.com/2021/02/19/brokerages-anticipate-corsair-gaming-inc-nasdaqcrsr-will-announce-quarterly-sales-of-444-82-million.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-content-design-corsair-acquires-140000904.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-content-design-corsair-acquires-140000904.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/CRSR/price_to_book_value\">https://ycharts.com/companies/CRSR/price_to_book_value</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/CRSR/debt_equity_ratio\">https://ycharts.com/companies/CRSR/debt_equity_ratio</a>\n-<a href=\"https://www.finscreener.org/title/key-ratio-history?kpidcp=58766&amp;kpi=5&amp;idcp=58766#:%7E:text=(CRSR)%20is%203.00\">https://www.finscreener.org/title/key-ratio-history?kpidcp=58766&amp;kpi=5&amp;idcp=58766#:~:text=(CRSR)%20is%203.00</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/short-interest/\">https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/short-interest/</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Disclosure: I&#39;m not a financial advisor.
