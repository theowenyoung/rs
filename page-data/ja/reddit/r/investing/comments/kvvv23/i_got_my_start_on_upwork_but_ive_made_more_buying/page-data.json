I found a few of my biggest clients on the site. I think Upwork has the potential to kill it in the WFH sector in the coming years, simply because they have been so focused on making a platform for large companies to come and find work. I bought the company stock earlier in 2020 (well, I bought at the IPO, sold, and bought again).</p>\n\n<p>The stock has killed it since then, and I&#39;ve made more on the investment than I have on the platform (still a top-rated freelancer even though I barely use it).</p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, I think Upwork&#39;s fatal flaw is their inability to keep people from moving off-platform for payments. There is absolutely no way for the company to know if a client or the freelancer move off-site after an initial contract is completed. From what I understand, all communication needs to stay on-site until a contract is started now. Okay, but then you can move off-platform for communication. Then there&#39;s the inevitable discussion of &quot;Hey, do you have PayPal?&quot; or &quot;Let&#39;s move you onto our company bill-pay system.&quot; All that has to be done is end the contract as a successful completion on Upwork and they&#39;re now separated and working off-site.</p>\n\n<p>This happens ALL the time, and I can see why. Even PayPal fees are less than UW&#39;s percentage, even if it moves into the 10% and 5% range.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are the lowest bidders driving down everyone&#39;s rates on the site. There are also scammers. I found someone on there using my entire profile bio, word-for-word (reported it, taken down).</p>\n\n<p>Even with their flaws, Upwork stock is surging and has been upgraded by most analysts. Imagine how awesome they&#39;d be if they fixed the issues.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kvvv23/i_got_my_start_on_upwork_but_ive_made_more_buying/","title":"I got my start on Upwork, but I've made more buying their actual stock (UPWK) than I have on the platform","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-13T01:55:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-13 01:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kvvv23","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kvvv23/i_got_my_start_on_upwork_but_ive_made_more_buying/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kvvv23/i_got_my_start_on_upwork_but_ive_made_more_buying/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"AllenWatson23","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AllenWatson23","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"AllenWatson23","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我是在Upwork上起家的，但我买他们的实际股票(UPWK)比我在平台上赚得更多。","the_new_excerpt":"我想知道你对Upwork（UPWK）长期潜力的看法。\n\n我在Upwork上开始了我的自由职业，因为一个家庭成员建议。I\n在网站上找到了我最大的几个客户。我认为Upwork有潜力\n在未来的几年里，他们将扼杀在WFH行业，只是因为他们有... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我是在Upwork上起家的，但我買他們的實際股票(UPWK)比我在平臺上賺得更多。","the_new_excerpt":"我想知道你對Upwork（UPWK）長期潛力的看法。\n\n我在Upwork上開始了我的自由職業，因爲一個家庭成員建議。I\n在網站上找到了我最大的幾個客戶。我認爲Upwork有潛力\n在未來的幾年裏，他們將扼殺在WFH行業，只是因爲他們有... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l66m9e","excerpt":"Schwab brokerage account locked for 29 days, banned from TD Ameritrade\n\nForgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub\n\nI'll start with Charles Schwab.\n\nI had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account.
