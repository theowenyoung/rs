They&#39;re going to lead to the largest mass unemployment rise as they make drivers unnecessary</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love people&#39;s opinions about my take on the future of EV and whether I&#39;m off base or too optimistic</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: In NIO for 140 shares @ $22</p>\n\n<p>My main argument: EV companies are currently amazon in their bookshop phase</p>\n\n<p>I would argue that the valuations of both TSLA, NIO and other large EV companies is seriously undervalued - I&#39;m not basing this on the number of cars they manufacture nor the effectiveness of their electric battery potential but on the billions they&#39;re investing in the development of full self driving automation.</p>\n\n<p>In the next 10 years, we are likely to see full automation especially with the advent of quantum computing leading to a huge increase in computational power (<a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023\">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023</a>) - The companies that are heavily investing in developing this technology aren&#39;t the classic car manufactures such as GM, Chevrolet or Chrysler but instead the large EV companies that have grown exponentially in the past year. Like many people I&#39;m viewing companies like NIO or TSLA as tech companies and not car manufacturers. They&#39;re main value is in the code they develop for automation.</p>\n\n<p>Once full autonomous driving becomes realistic, these companies can lease their code as a service and basically replace the need for any job which requires drivers i.e. delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi drivers.</p>\n\n<p>The main example I&#39;ve been using for this is Domino&#39;s Pizza in the UK - They have about 1126 stores in the UK, let&#39;s say they conservatively they hire 5 delivery drivers per store and those drivers on average work about 5 days a week and a total of 6 hours per day (the three hours around lunch and three around dinner) - Let&#39;s also assume they only get paid minimum wage - This comes out to a total expenditure of about £80mill per year ($110 mill) for dominoes just based on paying their drivers wages, not countering in fuel or other expenditures that they do also cover - And that&#39;s only one company in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>If automation occurs, which again these companies are investing heavily in and the underlying infrastructure and technology is beginning to reach basic requirements, these EV companies can create a code as service model along with the profit from actually selling the car and basically make drivers redundant</p>\n\n<p>My argument is that basically at the moment these EV companies are amazon in their bookshop phase, people are betting that they&#39;ll sell lots of books (cars in this case because they&#39;re clean energy) and I think they&#39;re going to end up becoming juggernauts that basically take over our daily lives to the same extent amazon now does</p>\n\n<p>Obvs I might be wrong and in fact I&#39;d love to hear some bearish arguments - I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re not in a bubble but I think these companies in 10 years time will be steals at their current prices</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lq8liw/why_ev_isnt_the_bubble_we_think_it_is/","title":"Why EV isn't the bubble we think it is","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T07:10:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 07:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lq8liw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lq8liw/why_ev_isnt_the_bubble_we_think_it_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lq8liw/why_ev_isnt_the_bubble_we_think_it_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Kingmaker251","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kingmaker251","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Kingmaker251","score":152,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么电动汽车不是我们想象中的泡沫？","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR：电动车在未来10年将成为全球最大的产业。\n不是因为它的绿色能源而是因为自动化。他们将\n导致最大规模的失业率上升，因为他们使司机没有必要。\n\n我想听听大家对我对电动车未来的看法......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼電動汽車不是我們想象中的泡沫？","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR：電動車在未來10年將成爲全球最大的產業。\n不是因爲它的綠色能源而是因爲自動化。他們將\n導致最大規模的失業率上升，因爲他們使司機沒有必要。\n\n我想聽聽大家對我對電動車未來的看法......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m0j6pn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0j6pn/hold_boys_we_going_for_a_mil/","title":"Hold boys we going for a mil 🙌💎","date":"March 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"握住孩子们，我们要去一个里程碑🙌💎","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"握住孩子們，我們要去一個里程碑🙌💎","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m0p9qe","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0p9qe/prepare_your_chest_dear_ape/","title":"Prepare your chest, dear ape!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 08, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"准备好你的胸部，亲爱的猩猩！","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"準備好你的胸部，親愛的猩猩！","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lq8liw","previousId":"RedditPost-m0j6pn","nextId":"RedditPost-m0p9qe","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lq8liw/why_ev_isnt_the_bubble_we_think_it_is/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
