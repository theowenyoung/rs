It allows Cronos the flexibility to take investments from other companies such as, for example, a big food company. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The proceeds from Altria&#39;s investment will enable us to more quickly expand our global infrastructure and distribution footprint, while also increasing investments in R&amp;D and brands that resonate with our consumer,&quot; Cronos CEO Mike Gorenstein said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Its established U.S. presence should, therefore, serve to benefit Cronos, when cannabis is legalized federally. I suspect majority ownership will come into effect within the next 6-8 months. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;most important aspect of growth is going to be innovation and R&amp;D; The proceeds from Altria&#39;s investment will enable us to more quickly expand our global infrastructure and distribution footprint, while also increasing investments in R&amp;D and brands that resonate with our consumers. Importantly, Altria shares our vision of driving long-term value through innovation <strong>(technology)</strong>, and we look forward to continuing to differentiate in this area. As one of the largest holding companies in the adult consumer products sector, Altria has decades of experience in regulatory, government affairs, compliance, product development and brand management that we expect to leverage, particularly as new markets for cannabis open around the world.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This strategic partnership provides Cronos Group with additional financial resources, product development and commercialization capabilities, and deep regulatory expertise to better position the Company to compete, scale and lead the rapidly growing global cannabis industry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cronos Brands</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.peaceplus.com/\">Peace Plus CBD</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>We bring together leading extractors and farmers to add something better to our world: a high-quality, hemp-derived CBD made with your potential in mind.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://peacenaturals.com/\">Peace Naturals</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Peace has always been committed to providing high-quality medicinal cannabis since the company was founded in 2013.
