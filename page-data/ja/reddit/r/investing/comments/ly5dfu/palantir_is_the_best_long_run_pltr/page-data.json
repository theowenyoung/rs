Essentially these two software work by integrating with the customer&#39;s existing system and simulating different operational models and outcomes for different decisions that the customer makes. To me, this technology is revolutionary as proven by how unpredictable the state of the world economy is right now. </p>\n\n<p>A few of the big names that are working with them now is <strong>IBM</strong>, <strong>PG&amp;E</strong>, <strong>BP</strong>, and many hedge funds and banks, and a big one recently is a 31m contract with <strong>NHS England</strong> where they are working to handle vaccine allocation <strong>(</strong>this is significant as the UK is facing a historically tough recession<strong>)</strong></p>\n\n<p>They have been consistently working with the US government on multiple contracts using Gotham, from finding bin Laden to verifying Iran&#39;s nuclear presence in 2018. Palantir is <strong>one of the four</strong> institutions that were given DoD IL-5 and on their way to DoD IL-6, to give you a scale Google is DoD IL-2 and Oracle is DoD IL-4, meaning they are responsible for handling extremely sensitive information for the DOD, their most recent contract is <em>project Maven</em>. Essentially Palantir is the CIA&#39;s AI twin.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back at the fundamentals, especially with the P/S ratio of over 40 right now, it can be overpriced to get in. But in the near future, PLTR will be the best stock to hold for 5+ years as the sky is their limit.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: forgot to put my position 300 @24.9</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ly5dfu/palantir_is_the_best_long_run_pltr/","title":"Palantir is the best long run $PLTR","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T07:27:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 07:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ly5dfu","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ly5dfu/palantir_is_the_best_long_run_pltr/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ly5dfu/palantir_is_the_best_long_run_pltr/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"jacquesmioff","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jacquesmioff","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jacquesmioff","score":565,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Palantir是最好的长跑$PLTR。","the_new_excerpt":"TL，DR：$PLTR是一个巨大的多头游戏，该公司有其脚趾浸在\n基本上每个行业都有。\n\n以下是一些基本面：市值446亿，2020年营收11亿（4.82亿起）。\n商业，6.18亿来自于政府），以及持续的盈利节拍。\n\n2020年，其营收增长47%，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Palantir是最好的長跑$PLTR。","the_new_excerpt":"TL，DR：$PLTR是一個巨大的多頭遊戲，該公司有其腳趾浸在\n基本上每個行業都有。\n\n以下是一些基本面：市值446億，2020年營收11億（4.82億起）。\n商業，6.18億來自於政府），以及持續的盈利節拍。\n\n2020年，其營收增長47%，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1373404207643000835","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1373404207643000835","title":"Larry Summers economic probabilities:\n\n40% chance of recession\n\n40% chance everything is fine\n\n40% chance of stagflation\n\n40% chance of hyperinflation\n\n40% chance of hyperdeflation\n\n40% chance Gonzaga wins it all\n\n40% chance he wishes he would’ve believed the Winklevoss twins","date":"March 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"拉里-萨默斯的经济概率。\n\n经济衰退的可能性为40%\n\n40%的机会，一切正常\n\n40%的机会出现滞胀\n\n40%的机会出现恶性通货膨胀\n\n40%的机会出现高通胀\n\n40%的可能性是冈萨加全胜\n\n40%的可能性，他希望自己会相信温克艾沃斯双胞胎的说法","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"拉里-薩默斯的經濟概率。\n\n經濟衰退的可能性爲40%\n\n40%的機會，一切正常\n\n40%的機會出現滯脹\n\n40%的機會出現惡性通貨膨脹\n\n40%的機會出現高通脹\n\n40%的可能性是岡薩加全勝\n\n40%的可能性，他希望自己會相信溫克艾沃斯雙胞胎的說法","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m91bmu","excerpt":"https://www.ft.com/content/86bef727-66dd-45cf-8ca6-85e846a276fd\n\n> Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired the governor of the central bank\n> on Friday just three months into his four-year term and two days after an\n> interest rate rise imposed as the bank fought to tame inflation.\n> \n> Naci…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m91bmu/erdogan_ousts_turkey_central_bank_governor_in/","title":"Erdogan ousts Turkey central bank governor in shock move","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 21, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"埃尔多安震惊地将土耳其央行行长赶下台","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.ft.com/content/86bef727-66dd-45cf-8ca6-85e846a276fd\n\n> 土耳其总统雷杰普-塔伊普-埃尔多安解雇央行行长。\n> 周五，他的四年任期刚满三个月，两天后，他就被诊断出患有癌症。\n> 在银行努力抑制通货膨胀的同时，实行利率上调。\n> \n> Naci...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"埃爾多安震驚地將土耳其央行行長趕下臺","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.ft.com/content/86bef727-66dd-45cf-8ca6-85e846a276fd\n\n> 土耳其總統雷傑普-塔伊普-埃爾多安解僱央行行長。\n> 週五，他的四年任期剛滿三個月，兩天後，他就被診斷出患有癌症。\n> 在銀行努力抑制通貨膨脹的同時，實行利率上調。\n> \n> Naci...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ly5dfu","previousId":"TweetPost-1373404207643000835","nextId":"RedditPost-m91bmu","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ly5dfu/palantir_is_the_best_long_run_pltr/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
