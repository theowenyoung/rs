The fitness offering, I think, pairs really well with their roster on the team which (as covered above) is highly experienced in sports and media.</p>\n\n<p>Peloton is due for a competitor. It&#39;s a great platform but its not the solution EVERYONE needs. MYX Fitness&#39; products offer added choice to a marketplace that is foaming at the mouth for more options.</p>\n\n<p>The company has been around for over 20 years which is just a nice reassurance</p>\n\n<p>Because of how the deal is structured, it appears the company will now be, more than ever, able to expand via acquisitions (they actually mention this in the article) and a HEAVY digital marketing spend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ticker:</strong> FRX (for now)</p>\n\n<p><strong>More info:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/beachbody-to-go-public-via-3-way-merger-with-forest-road-spac-and-myx-fitness-2021-02-10\">MarketWatch Coverage</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lh4k7m/shaq_lebron_james_former_tiktok_ceos_spac/","title":"Shaq, Lebron James, & former TikTok CEOs SPAC announce $3B merger with Beachbody","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T05:09:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 05:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lh4k7m","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lh4k7m/shaq_lebron_james_former_tiktok_ceos_spac/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lh4k7m/shaq_lebron_james_former_tiktok_ceos_spac/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"yarnbelly","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/yarnbelly","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"yarnbelly","score":71,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"沙克、勒布朗-詹姆斯与前TikTok CEO SPAC宣布与Beachbody进行30亿美元的合并。","the_new_excerpt":"与此有关的一些人（说实话，这也是我为什么这么做的一个重要原因。\n兴奋）。)\n\n * 沙克\n *凯文-梅尔，TikTok的前CEO。\n *勒布朗-詹姆斯\n * 阿诺德-施瓦辛格\n * Tom Staggs，前迪斯尼首席财务官和首席运营官。\n\n公告刚刚出来。完整版【https://on.wsj.com/2Nhy8de】。\n\n下面是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"沙克、勒布朗-詹姆斯與前TikTok CEO SPAC宣佈與Beachbody進行30億美元的合併。","the_new_excerpt":"與此有關的一些人（說實話，這也是我爲什麼這麼做的一個重要原因。\n興奮）。)\n\n * 沙克\n *凱文-梅爾，TikTok的前CEO。\n *勒布朗-詹姆斯\n * 阿諾德-施瓦辛格\n * Tom Staggs，前迪斯尼首席財務官和首席運營官。\n\n公告剛剛出來。完整版【https://on.wsj.com/2Nhy8de】。\n\n下面是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1364756593406054407","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1364756593406054407","title":"Buffett right-hand man Munger says it’s ‘really stupid to have a culture which encourages [so] much gambling in stocks’: https://t.co/uiBskd0t4y","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"巴菲特的得力助手芒格说，\"鼓励股票赌博的文化真的很愚蠢\"：https://t.co/uiBskd0t4y。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"巴菲特的得力助手芒格說，\"鼓勵股票賭博的文化真的很愚蠢\"：https://t.co/uiBskd0t4y。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ls2ow1","excerpt":"With the GME price rising significantly again, we will be using this thread to\nhouse all GME-related posts, as we expect a large surge in posting related to\nthis stock.\n\nAll GME-related posts elsewhere will be removed.\n\nHave a lovely day!","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ls2ow1/gme_megathread_for_thursday_february_25th_2021/","title":"GME Megathread for Thursday, February 25th, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 25, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"2021年2月25日（星期四）GME Megathread。","the_new_excerpt":"随着GME价格再次大幅上涨，我们将通过这条线来\n所有与全球环境管理有关的职位，因为我们预计与全球环境管理有关的职位会大量增加。\n这只股票。\n\n其他地方所有与GME相关的帖子将被删除。\n\n祝你有愉快的一天!","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年2月25日（星期四）GME Megathread。","the_new_excerpt":"隨着GME價格再次大幅上漲，我們將通過這條線來\n所有與全球環境管理有關的職位，因爲我們預計與全球環境管理有關的職位會大量增加。\n這隻股票。\n\n其他地方所有與GME相關的帖子將被刪除。\n\n祝你有愉快的一天!","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lh4k7m","previousId":"TweetPost-1364756593406054407","nextId":"RedditPost-ls2ow1","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lh4k7m/shaq_lebron_james_former_tiktok_ceos_spac/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
