At a high level, uranium needs to be in the $50+ (some say $60+) range in order to cover the cost of production. Right now the spot price is hovering around $30.   </p>\n\n<p>That being said, uranium is outperforming. So what then is driving this run? Are we likely to see a move in spot soon?</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I think that the equities are ahead of themselves a little bit and that we could be seeing a pull back soon. I hope not. Still, the spot price is a little bit of a question mark for me because I have seen a number of interviews saying that we are very close for a move in the uranium price. This has led me to the view that I should hold my positions and slowly build until the spot price starts to move.  It’s a risk, but my hypothesis is that the real move will far outpace where we are today.  </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, uranium is about climate change more than anything and so I am glad we are ahead of schedule. Nuclear is the only way to achieve the carbon goals. </p>\n\n<p>I will be watching closely in the next few weeks for any movement in the uranium price. Should the spot rise as many of us expect, uranium stock prices will soar.</p>\n\n<p>As always. I am interested in how others perceive the current landscape. Any and all feedback is appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m7ih59/the_current_state_of_uranium_a_move_in_spot_price/","title":"The Current State of Uranium.
