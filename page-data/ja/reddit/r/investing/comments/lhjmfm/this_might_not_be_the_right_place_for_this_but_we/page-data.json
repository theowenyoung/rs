Need a rant. </p>\n\n<p>I believe Wealthsimple’s recent marketing campaigns are predatory. I know there is a start-up definition for predatory marketing with a slightly positive connotation - this is not the case here. They are intentionally misleading new entrants to the world of investing. </p>\n\n<p>———————————————————</p>\n\n<p>I deleted my Wealthsimple trade account a while ago (moved to QT). They have gamified investing while pursuing a very important initiative of making investing for everyone. I want to be clear that i endorse this pursuit... However, they have now lost the plot. Entirely. </p>\n\n<p>Some examples of practises I see all day every day on almost every platform:</p>\n\n<p>• Misleading: account chart always green. Demonstrating gains only on weekly - yearly basis</p>\n\n<p>• Language: trading versus investing. Purposefully oversimplifying the investment process </p>\n\n<p>• Tickers: purposefully advertising hot tech stocks and the like </p>\n\n<p>• Branding: it’s a young person in a tik tok like video telling you to just download the app and makes those buys and sells. It’s turned the pursuit of learning about businesses and buying good ones into a tik tok trend</p>\n\n<p>• Positioning: commercials trying to make the founder seem like an outsider who is standing up to the big guys - this is not the case. You are trading all the time, you can’t walk your dog without checking your account or making a trade </p>\n\n<p>I could go on and on. It is so fucking annoying to see. </p>\n\n<p>What are people’s thoughts on this? Am I overreacting, this really scares me</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhjmfm/this_might_not_be_the_right_place_for_this_but_we/","title":"This might not be the right place for this - but we should talk about WealthSimple’s marketing.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T17:39:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 17:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lhjmfm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhjmfm/this_might_not_be_the_right_place_for_this_but_we/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhjmfm/this_might_not_be_the_right_place_for_this_but_we/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Pure-arbitrage","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pure-arbitrage","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Pure-arbitrage","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"这可能不是合适的地方 - 但我们应该谈谈WealthSimple的营销。","the_new_excerpt":"版主：如果这个不合适，对不起。根据需要指点我其他地方。需要发发牢骚。\n\n我认为Wealthsimple最近的营销活动是掠夺性的。我知道有\n是掠夺式营销的创业定义，略带正能量的\n内涵--这里不是这样的。他们是故意...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這可能不是合適的地方 - 但我們應該談談WealthSimple的營銷。","the_new_excerpt":"版主：如果這個不合適，對不起。根據需要指點我其他地方。需要發發牢騷。\n\n我認爲Wealthsimple最近的營銷活動是掠奪性的。我知道有\n是掠奪式營銷的創業定義，略帶正能量的\n內涵--這裏不是這樣的。他們是故意...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lsiga5","excerpt":"Consensus Expected EPS: $0.87\n\nActual Adjusted Diluted EPS: $1.14\n\nHighlights:\n\n * 187% YoY adjusted revenue growth\n\n * 526% YoY adjusted net income growth\n\n * Q1 2021 expected ~95% increase in closed loan volume over Q1 2020 (which\n   would be about a 5% drop from Q4 2020)\n\n * New corporate partner…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lsiga5/rocket_companies_rkt_crushes_earnings_expectations/","title":"Rocket Companies ($RKT) crushes earnings expectations","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"火箭公司($RKT)的盈利预期被粉碎了","the_new_excerpt":"一致预期每股收益：0.87元\n\n实际调整后摊薄后每股收益：1.14元\n\n亮点： * 187%。\n\n * 调整后收入同比增长187%。\n\n * 526%的调整后净收入同比增长。\n\n * 2021年第一季度预计已完成的贷款量比2020年第一季度增加约95%（其中\n   将比2020年第四季度下降约5%)\n\n * 新的公司合作伙伴...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"火箭公司($RKT)的盈利預期被粉碎了","the_new_excerpt":"一致預期每股收益：0.87元\n\n實際調整後攤薄後每股收益：1.14元\n\n亮點： * 187%。\n\n * 調整後收入同比增長187%。\n\n * 526%的調整後淨收入同比增長。\n\n * 2021年第一季度預計已完成的貸款量比2020年第一季度增加約95%（其中\n   將比2020年第四季度下降約5%)\n\n * 新的公司合作伙伴...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lsgqig","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsgqig/i_dont_need_fox_business_to_hold_me_accountable/","title":"I don't need Fox Business to hold me accountable, but I'll take it!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 25, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我不需要福克斯商业公司对我负责，但我愿意接受!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我不需要福克斯商業公司對我負責，但我願意接受!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lhjmfm","previousId":"RedditPost-lsiga5","nextId":"RedditPost-lsgqig","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhjmfm/this_might_not_be_the_right_place_for_this_but_we/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
