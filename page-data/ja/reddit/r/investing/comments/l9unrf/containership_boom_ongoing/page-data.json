These ships are typically contracted for 1-2 or even 3+ years. So when we talk about 2021 EBITDA, they’ve already locked in about 80% of it and over 50% of 2022 rates.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve covered the shipping sector extensively on Seeking Alpha for nearly 10 years and am also on Twitter (@mintzmyer). I figured I’d open up a conversation here and see if anyone is interested in the sector. $NMCI still trades for an unbelievable P/E of under 2x.</p>\n\n<p>Nick First (@allthingsventured on Twitter) has recently written a new article on Navios Partners with his own financial projections:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4402328-new-navios-partners-favorite-play-for-supercycle\">Article on Navios Maritime Partners</a></p>\n\n<p>I believe we’re just getting started here. For my disclosure, I’m long nearly every name in the space- $ATCO $CMRE $CPLP $DAC $MPCC (Oslo) $NMCI $NMM (they own most of $NMCI) and mostly recently: $ZIM. </p>\n\n<p>I have about 10% of my wealth in $NMCI/$NMM. Average basis in NMCI is in the very low $1s after buying a lot this summer at 70-80c. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been a long time Reddit user, but I’ve never really posted much about stocks so please forgive the basic post. I’m happy to answer any questions- cheers!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Wow thanks for the great engagement so far.
