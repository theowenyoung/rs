I think it’s very clear the fear indicator is ticking up week by week of an impending crash. Does it make sense? Of course, valuations at an all time high and some companies are definitely profiting more then ever, but many are not.</p>\n\n<p>Now for the stocks I own, I am definitely a long term holder. This past week my portfolio would’ve dropped roughly 5% or so had I not leveraged it with (Sqqq) calls.</p>\n\n<p>SQQQ is essentially suppose to be a 3x mirror inverse of the NASDAQ, which are a lot of the crazy ballooned tech companies. So food for thought for any of you guys, if you think a crash is coming maybe leverage it with some sort of put action.</p>\n\n<p>What I would NOT do - do not sell your long term stocks if a drop starts coming because you’ll inevitably sell at the wrong time and we don’t know when/if the market is going to crash. I just happen to think it is sooner rather than later, or at least a solid 10-20% correction.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer - I’m not a financial advisor but sharing my thoughts on the immediate future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ltpa0m/how_to_leverage_your_portfolio_if_you_believe_a/","title":"How to leverage your portfolio if you believe a market drop incoming","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-28T01:03:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-28 01:03","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ltpa0m","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ltpa0m/how_to_leverage_your_portfolio_if_you_believe_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ltpa0m/how_to_leverage_your_portfolio_if_you_believe_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"HaMEZSmiff","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HaMEZSmiff","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"HaMEZSmiff","score":98,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果你认为市场下跌即将到来，如何利用你的投资组合？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，伙计们。\n\n只是想分享我过去两周的一些想法。我认为这是\n非常明确的是，恐惧指标正在逐周上升，即将发生的崩盘。\n这有意义吗？当然，估值在历史高位，一些公司\n肯定是获利更多，但很多... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你認爲市場下跌即將到來，如何利用你的投資組合？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，夥計們。\n\n只是想分享我過去兩週的一些想法。我認爲這是\n非常明確的是，恐懼指標正在逐週上升，即將發生的崩盤。\n這有意義嗎？當然，估值在歷史高位，一些公司\n肯定是獲利更多，但很多... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m4off4","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4off4/apes_together_strong/","title":"APES TOGETHER STRONG!!! 🚀🦍🚀","date":"March 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"APES TOGETHER STRONG!!! 🚀🦍🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"APES TOGETHER STRONG!!! 🚀🦍🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m4dzyf","excerpt":"*I'm not a financial advisor nor a feline.\\*\n\nMWK is a huge growth company changing the name of the game by using AI to sell\nproducts.
