The annual report has come out since I last posted, and since I actually sit down and read 10-K&#39;s now (yes i am old), so I&#39;ll share my thoughts:</p>\n\n<p>Before I do that though, this guy from Seeking Alpha did the same, and has pretty graphs to go along with that.  I&#39;m not going to try to write out ascii charts here in reddit markdown, so here you go:  <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408746-s-official-tanger-survived-pandemic\">https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408746-s-official-tanger-survived-pandemic</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to repeat some of the things he does, but here&#39;s my take on the 10-K (which you can read here:  <a href=\"http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000899715/cb76277e-f5f1-4304-9899-6e8259a30b10.pdf\">http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000899715/cb76277e-f5f1-4304-9899-6e8259a30b10.pdf</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Bullish case:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>99% of stores back open, 99% leased square footage.  Traffic levels back to 96%, 99% if you exclude Canada.  I live very near the Tanger Outlets in Rehoboth Beach, and it is PACKED, and tourist season hasn&#39;t even started here.  Nike and Crocs in particular always seem to have lines out the door.</p></li>\n<li><p>For those that don&#39;t know, these aren&#39;t just strip malls or outlets in middle America -- they choose vacation/tourist destinations, where when you take a week&#39;s vacation, &quot;going to the outlets&quot; is something you do on one of the days.  <em>I</em> don&#39;t do it, I hate shopping, but it&#39;s unquestionable this happens.</p></li>\n<li><p>Given that these outlets are in tourist destinations, this is generally high value real estate, which obviously has shot up in value.  The 10-K states that out of the 31 outlet centers they own, they own the land underlying in 25 of them, and ground leases on 6 -- the nearest lease expires in 2024 (Riverhead, NY) but they have a 15 year option on renewal.  Granted these types of real estate holdings are relatively illiquid, but the value gives them plenty of access to credit.</p></li>\n<li><p>Speaking of credit, their loans are at very low interest rates, and they have plenty of available credit on hand.  Given the worst has passed, and they&#39;ve already reinstated a dividend (though not fully back to what it was), there&#39;s really no risk here in regards to this.</p></li>\n<li><p>95% of 4th quarter rents collected, 1% deferred, 1% under negotiation, 1% concessions/lease restructuring, only 2% at risk due to bankruptcy of tenants/financial weakness.  The stores are open, paying on time, all is basically back to normal already.</p></li>\n<li><p>New CEO, Stephen Yalof, starts off 2021 -- came from Simon Property Group, which is <em>great</em> -- I&#39;ll get into that bit later.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bearish cases / danger signs:</p>\n\n<p>As the SA article said, Tanger gets 16% of their rent from 4 companies:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Gap (Gap, Banana Republic, Janie &amp; Jack, Old Navy)</li>\n<li>PVH Corp (Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, Calvin Klein)</li>\n<li>Ascena Retail Group (LOFT, Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant, Justice)</li>\n<li>Under Armour (duh)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While some of those have struggled, usually there are other stores in the portfolio picking up the slack.  GAP/Banana Republic isn&#39;t doing as well, but Old Navy has been crushing it, for instance.</p>\n\n<p>The risk is some of those companies don&#39;t bounce back as expected and enter bankruptcy.  Generally, the outlet stores though are the <em>last</em> to close.. random mall stores will be first, outlets will go out last.  I&#39;m not overly familiar with what&#39;s up and coming in new clothing stores / chains / etc, so this is where, for me, it gets a little nebulous.</p>\n\n<p>The base rent per square foot took a dive in 2020, but to be expected.  It was 21.10, 92% occupancy.  2019 was 97%, 25.35/sqft.  Going back further years, those #s are pretty steady -- 2016 was the best, 98%, 26.10/sqft.  So we have had some slippage, though pretty minor, from 2016-2019.  It&#39;s a question of what they can get 2021 sqft/occupancy levels back to and how quickly.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>One thing that annoys me about Tanger Outlets though from an investor standpoint, is that restaurants are not a real part of the outlets they have.  The one by me has a Chipotle and a lol Applebee&#39;s, and that&#39;s basically it for food options.  </p>\n\n<p>Having more mid-tier sit down restaurants in the outlets, so people can come shop, eat, and then shop some more, is what I&#39;d like to see.  Given the new CEO comes from <a href=\"https://www.simon.com/\">Simon Property Group</a>, and they have more restaurants in their tenant list, I&#39;m hopeful that if there are vacancies, we&#39;ll see restaurants fill in the gap.</p>\n\n<p>Disclosures:</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been long on Tanger for a while now, own 1100 shares of stock, and Jan 2022 20c and 30c options.  My intent is to hold onto the shares for some time as I&#39;m happy with the dividend and want to see what the new CEO does with it, but close out call positions if we get a significant pop.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lx859p/the_bullish_case_for_tanger_outlets_1_month_later/","title":"The bullish case for Tanger Outlets, 1 month later.
