GameStop: $154.03.</p>\n\n<p>GameStop&#39;s 10-K disclosure:</p>\n\n<p>March 23, 2021, GameStop announces an undisclosed &quot;large proportion&quot; of their stock is shorted:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. <strong>To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.</strong> Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze.</strong> A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html\">https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html</a></p>\n\n<p>OK.
