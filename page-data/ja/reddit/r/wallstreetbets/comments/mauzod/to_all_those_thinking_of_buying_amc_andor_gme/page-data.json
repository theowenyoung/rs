When you buy these stocks you are joining a battle.  If you think that you may not be able to handle it, then please be safe and stay out of the fight.  It actually hurts the value of the stock when people sell, and those who have paper hands tend to sell.</p>\n\n<p>Simple economics teaches that an objects value is based on supply and demand.  If there is a high demand for something that has a short supply, the value goes up for that object.  In other words the more we buy and hold, the less supply there will be.  When the hedgies and market movers need to buy shares to cover their shorts and options, the demand for these shares will shoot up, and the value of the stock will shoot up as well, because we are holding on to the supply.</p>\n\n<p>When people sell their shares, they are providing more supply that drives the value of the stocks down.  That is why it is imperative that people who are currently buying these stocks HOLD.  We need diamond hands in this fight.</p>\n\n<p>After reading that, you think that there is too much risk involved and want to invest more wisely, there is nothing wrong with that. You are actually helping us by realizing that now. That just leaves more shares for the diamond hands to buy.</p>\n\n<p>After reading that, and you believe you are ready to join the fight, then welcome to the Ape Army.  We have become a family and will look out for one another.  Be strong ✋💎🤚🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mauzod/to_all_those_thinking_of_buying_amc_andor_gme/","title":"To all those thinking of buying $AMC and/or $GME:","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-22T21:24:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-22 21:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mauzod","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mauzod/to_all_those_thinking_of_buying_amc_andor_gme/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mauzod/to_all_those_thinking_of_buying_amc_andor_gme/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"gegroff","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/gegroff","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"gegroff","score":13154,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"致所有想买入$AMC和/或$GME的人。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你手软请买比较安全的股票，比如$MSFT或$AAPL。的\n$AMC和$GME的交易方式不适合胆小的人。当你买入\n这些股票你是在加入一场战斗。如果你认为自己可能无法做到\n处理好了，那就请你注意安全，不要参与战斗。它...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"致所有想買入$AMC和/或$GME的人。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你手軟請買比較安全的股票，比如$MSFT或$AAPL。的\n$AMC和$GME的交易方式不適合膽小的人。當你買入\n這些股票你是在加入一場戰鬥。如果你認爲自己可能無法做到\n處理好了，那就請你注意安全，不要參與戰鬥。它...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mre3bi","excerpt":"TLDR at the bottom.\n\nThe CEO of AMC has publicly promised yesterday to submit in writing with the SEC\nthat AMC does not plan to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized by\nshareholders in May.\n\nHappy to report that as of this morning AMC filed Statement…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mre3bi/amc_filed_with_the_sec_its_promise_not_to_issue/","title":"AMC filed with the SEC its promise not to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized in 2021 - but what does this really mean?","date":"April 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"AMCは、2021年に認可された場合、5億株の株式を発行しないという約束をSECに提出しましたが、これは実際には何を意味するのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"下部にTLDRがあります。\n\nAMCのCEOは、昨日、SECに書面で提出することを公約しました。\n5月に株主総会で承認された場合、AMCは5億株の発行を予定していないことを、昨日SECに書面で提出することを公約しました。\n書面を提出することを昨日公約しました。\n\nその結果、今朝、AMCはステートメントを提出しましたのでご報告します。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"AMC向美国证券交易委员会提交了其承诺，如果在2021年获得授权，将不会发行任何5亿股的股票--但这究竟意味着什么？","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR在底部。\n\nAMC的CEO昨天已经公开承诺，将向美国证监会提交书面材料。\nAMC不打算在获得授权的情况下发行任何5亿股股份。\n股东在五月。\n\n很高兴地报告，截至今天早上AMC提交了声明...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMC向美國證券交易委員會提交了其承諾，如果在2021年獲得授權，將不會發行任何5億股的股票--但這究竟意味着什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR在底部。\n\nAMC的CEO昨天已經公開承諾，將向美國證監會提交書面材料。\nAMC不打算在獲得授權的情況下發行任何5億股股份。\n股東在五月。\n\n很高興地報告，截至今天早上AMC提交了聲明...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mrm6b5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrm6b5/like_a_beast_cornered_and_im_not_talking_about/","title":"Like a beast cornered...
