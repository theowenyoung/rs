In the VW squeeze in 2008, they abandoned the ship. This time, NOT! They INCREASED their short position, around 140% of the free float is now shorted. If we hold, there is not Moon, not Mars, but ALPHA centauri potential! 🚀🚀🚀 </p>\n\n<p>2) DELTA-HEDGING. Last week, the maximum call strike was 60$. All the calls, every fucking single one, expired ITM. Biggest bank for us! This week, they sold new ones, maximum strike 115$. For next Friday. I repeat. For NEXT FRIDAY. Its Monday and we are already at 106$ premarket. These call sellers have to hedge to not loose too much next Friday and even next week! They will buy more shares. Ends in less shares for shorts to hedge. </p>\n\n<p>They outplay each other, and we sit in the middle like retarded autists holding our big dongus growing every day. ALL WE NEED TO DO IS HOLD, IF U WANT, BUT MORE! 🚀🚀🚀🙏🙏💎💎💎</p>\n\n<p>Fuck the shorts, fuck fundamentals. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. </p>\n\n<p>To all the new retards, u don&#39;t need to understand what&#39;s going on here. Nobody does. I&#39;m in since less than 150k gay autists, and all the big Tickers were right, every single time. Now more than ever. </p>\n\n<p>Special congrats to our God <a href=\"/u/deepfuckingvalue\">u/deepfuckingvalue</a>, who will bust the 20,000,000.00$ today. 🚀🚀 </p>\n\n<p>And for the boomers and the S.E.C., this is not financial advise, do as ur little lovely autist heart tells you to do.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nPositions: 12 shares @ 34.50€. </p>\n\n<p>Interesting read about short squeeze effects: &quot;The effect of short interest on the subsequent stock \nperformance in NASDAQ-100 companies&quot; - by Schindler.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: GME is the new toilet paper. Buy and hold it all. The shorts and the call sellers will be left with nothing and come knocking on your door with bags of cash because they don&#39;t want to shit in their bed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ld16/why_to_hold_gme/","title":"WHY TO HOLD GME","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-25T14:12:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-25 14:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l4ld16","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ld16/why_to_hold_gme/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ld16/why_to_hold_gme/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Hagizzo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hagizzo","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Hagizzo","score":3339,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么要持有GME","the_new_excerpt":"AUTISTS ASSEMBLE! 我们现在应该持有或做多GME的主要原因有两个。\n比以往任何时候都要多\n\n1）SHORTS加仓。在2008年的大众挤兑中，他们放弃了\n船。这一次，不！ - 他们增加了他们的空仓， 他们增加了他们的空头仓位， 约140％的。\n自由浮动现在是空的。如果我们持有，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼要持有GME","the_new_excerpt":"AUTISTS ASSEMBLE! 我們現在應該持有或做多GME的主要原因有兩個。\n比以往任何時候都要多\n\n1）SHORTS加倉。在2008年的大衆擠兌中，他們放棄了\n船。這一次，不！ - 他們增加了他們的空倉， 他們增加了他們的空頭倉位， 約140％的。\n自由浮動現在是空的。如果我們持有，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lcmxym","excerpt":"I'll start off by saying that, yes, I got pulled into the GME hype.
