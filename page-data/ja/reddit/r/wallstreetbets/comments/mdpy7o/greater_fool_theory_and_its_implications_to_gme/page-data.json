This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.</em></p>\n\n<p>Now you may be thinking, <strong>are we the greater fools?</strong> I bought at 250 like a good little ape, and my answer is <em>no</em>.</p>\n\n<p>First, let&#39;s acknowledge that GME is not worth $200, or $300, or $420.69, or $8008.101 . We aren&#39;t betting on the actual value, we&#39;re betting on the greater fools. We&#39;re betting on the short squeeze, and <em>its day will come</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The shorts will have to buy, no matter the price, so in this scenario <em>they are the greatest fools of all</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Melvin, Shitron, and other HF&#39;s will devolve below the monke and turn into single celled organisms only capable of breeding and shitting.</p>\n\n<p>How can I confirm this? Lets do some retard math.</p>\n\n<p>The average IQ defined in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale is 90-109, and since we&#39;re smooth brained, and in the &quot;Extremely low&quot; category, we&#39;re defined as 69 and below. So let&#39;s say we&#39;re all 69(nice). There are 9,665,680 <a href=\"/r/WSB\">r/WSB</a> members at the time of writing. Multiply total users by 69 and we get <strong>666,931,920</strong>. With our combined monke IQ&#39;s we have decided we like the stock. Melvin has 33 employees, who we&#39;ll say are in the &quot;Superior&quot; IQ classification of 130 and above. Using maths, we can conclude their combined IQ is 4,290. So who is the greater fool, Melvin, who doesn&#39;t like the stock with an IQ of 4,290, or <a href=\"/r/WSB\">r/WSB</a>, with a combined retard strength of 666,931,920 who like stonk.</p>\n\n<p>So get your chickens ready, the deep fryer is heating up and tendies will be ready soon.</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdpy7o/greater_fool_theory_and_its_implications_to_gme/","title":"Greater Fool Theory and it's Implications To GME","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-27T06:29:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-27 06:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mdpy7o","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdpy7o/greater_fool_theory_and_its_implications_to_gme/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdpy7o/greater_fool_theory_and_its_implications_to_gme/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Morpherman","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Morpherman","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Morpherman","score":1289,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"大傻瓜理论及其对GME的影响。","the_new_excerpt":"小伙伴们，今天我们要讲的是 \"大愚论\n\nInvestopedia对大傻瓜理论的定义如下。\n\n\"大傻瓜理论 \"指出，通过买入 \"大傻瓜 \"的股票可以赚钱\n证券，无论其价值是否被高估，都可以通过出售这些证券以获得利润。\n晚些时候。这是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"大傻瓜理論及其對GME的影響。","the_new_excerpt":"小夥伴們，今天我們要講的是 \"大愚論\n\nInvestopedia對大傻瓜理論的定義如下。\n\n\"大傻瓜理論 \"指出，通過買入 \"大傻瓜 \"的股票可以賺錢\n證券，無論其價值是否被高估，都可以通過出售這些證券以獲得利潤。\n晚些時候。這是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1385287390424715264","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1385287390424715264","title":"BIDEN CAN NOT TAKE MY CAPITAL GAINS, THIS IS SOCIALISM\n\n*has $1K in a robinhood account","date":"April 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"バイデンは私のキャピタルゲインを取ることはできない、これは社会主義だ。\n\n*ロビンフッドの口座に1Kドルを保有","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"拜登不能拿走我的资本收益，这就是社会主义\n\n*在Robinhood账户上有1千美元","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"拜登不能拿走我的資本收益，這就是社會主義\n\n*在Robinhood賬戶上有1千美元","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1385298299926859779","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1385298299926859779","title":"Reminder: \n\nThe stock market has returned around 10% per year in this time\n\nTax rates don't matter as much as you think\n\n[mutes replies] https://t.co/NhrdUzAIYS","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 22, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"思い出してください。\n\nこの間、株式市場は年率10％前後のリターンを記録している\n\n税率は思ったよりも重要ではない\n\n[mutes replies] https://t.co/NhrdUzAIYS","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"提醒一下。\n\n在这段时间里，股票市场每年的回报率约为10%。\n\n税率并不像你想象的那么重要\n\n[静音回复] https://t.co/NhrdUzAIYS","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"提醒一下。\n\n在這段時間裏，股票市場每年的回報率約爲10%。\n\n稅率並不像你想象的那麼重要\n\n[靜音回覆] https://t.co/NhrdUzAIYS","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mdpy7o","previousId":"TweetPost-1385287390424715264","nextId":"TweetPost-1385298299926859779","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdpy7o/greater_fool_theory_and_its_implications_to_gme/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
