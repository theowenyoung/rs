According to reddit, the top mods of the community were removed for violating rule 5 of the moderator guidelines, which is: &quot;healthy communities have moderators who are around to answer questions of their community and engage with the admins.&quot; The attempt of the top mods to remove all of us and censor you failed, thanks to the actions of the reddit admins. We are grateful to everyone in the community who stood up for us.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"/u/zjz\">/u/zjz</a> will also not be allowed to come back to moderate the subreddit. This is a decision made by reddit, not us, due to the instability that was created by his last post on the subreddit. We know the respect that you all have for him, each one of us mods has that respect for him too. The hard work and time that <a href=\"/u/zjz\">/u/zjz</a> put into the subreddit cannot be replaced, but we will try our best to keep the subreddit up to his lofty standards and our high expectations.</p>\n\n<p>Moving forward, we are working harder than ever and we need your help. Since <a href=\"/u/zjz\">/u/zjz</a> ran all of our bots and was also the most active mod, there is a massive void left by his absence. If anyone has the desire to code a new bot for us and/or the time to moderate, as well as the experience on WSB (at least one year), we would appreciate your help.</p>\n\n<p>Do not harass any former moderators. We need to move on from this and put it behind us all. This is the best community on reddit, let&#39;s keep it that way.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/gBFWFVm\">Proof</a>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le8skv/regarding_the_removal_of_uzjz_and_other_moderators/","title":"Regarding the removal of /u/zjz and other moderators","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-07T05:07:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-07 05:07","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"le8skv","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le8skv/regarding_the_removal_of_uzjz_and_other_moderators/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le8skv/regarding_the_removal_of_uzjz_and_other_moderators/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/jaZ0l_MhlQ4B6-xjhJ0pHIGH2RFjG3WJEfQLqzJPpP0.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f7f40f62435bad52a6d9fc0901ba9f6a0db77525","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"theycallmeryan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theycallmeryan","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"theycallmeryan","score":4004,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"关于撤换/u/zjz和其他版主的问题。","the_new_excerpt":"很多人都知道，/r/wallstreetbets在以下方面发生了一些变化。\n在过去几天的mod榜上。根据reddit的消息，在过去的几天里，排名靠前的mods的。\n社区因违反版主指南第5条而被删除，该条规定\n是。 - \"健康的社区有版主在身边..: \"健康的社区有主持人谁是周围... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於撤換/u/zjz和其他版主的問題。","the_new_excerpt":"很多人都知道，/r/wallstreetbets在以下方面發生了一些變化。\n在過去幾天的mod榜上。根據reddit的消息，在過去的幾天裏，排名靠前的mods的。\n社區因違反版主指南第5條而被刪除，該條規定\n是。 - \"健康的社區有版主在身邊..: \"健康的社區有主持人誰是周圍... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lob3m5","excerpt":"$CRWD - Crowdstrike: Internet services and infastructure\nMarket Cap: $53 Billion\nPrice/Sales: 70\nRevenue: $761M\nProfit: -$102M\nModel: Software as a service model protecting consumer endpoints with security\nsolutions.\n$BB - Blackberry: Communications Equipment\nMarket Cap: $6 Billion\nPrice/Sales:…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lob3m5/crwd_vs_bb/","title":"$CRWD vs $BB","date":"February 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$CRWD vs $BB","the_new_excerpt":"$CRWD - Crowdstrike。互联网服务和基础设施\n市值：530亿美元\n价格/销售：70\n收入：7.61亿美元\n利润：-1.02亿美元\n模式。软件即服务模式，以安全保护消费者端点。\n解决方案.\n$BB - 黑莓。通信设备\n市值：60亿美元\n价格/销售：...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$CRWD vs $BB","the_new_excerpt":"$CRWD - Crowdstrike。互聯網服務和基礎設施\n市值：530億美元\n價格/銷售：70\n收入：7.61億美元\n利潤：-1.02億美元\n模式。軟件即服務模式，以安全保護消費者端點。\n解決方案.\n$BB - 黑莓。通信設備\n市值：60億美元\n價格/銷售：...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-logbql","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/logbql/mods_keep_deleting_6969_donation_to_my_local/","title":"Mods keep deleting, $6969 donation to my local center for people experiencing homelessness.
