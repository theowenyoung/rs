Here&#39;s the kicker, I live in Toronto, Canada. If you want a detached house that&#39;s not a meth den, you need to either : be making 6 figures, be a mega-frugal buzz-kill for years, have rich parents, or have a very successful only fans. But here&#39;s where my superpower kicks in: im cripplingly retarded, im so retarded that i should be sterilized so i never re-produce. I took the roughly 50k that I had saved up from living at home with my parents until I was 27 like some dirty man-child goblin feeding off of Cheez-Its crumbs and Frozen Pizzas, and, I took another ~30k from my Line of Credit to YOLO $MNMD, an at the time an OTC Schedule 1 drug company. This was all the DD I did:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>googled shroom stock companies, $MNMD was one of the biggest with by far the most pipelines for FDA approval,** lizard brain activated** more chances for success i guess or some shit</li>\n<li>I&#39;ve done every drug below the Injectable tier, MDMA, Shrooms, LSD etc\nLogo and website cool <strong>ape brain engaged</strong></li>\n<li>i wish i was kidding but thats it, there is no more bullet points, it took about 35 minutes of googling to YOLO $80k, every penny i had to my name.\nI bought in last December and on multiple occasions I&#39;ve had the ability to sell and finally buy my own place and start building equity, but then i&#39;ll just be house poor for 25 years. I always knew this was going to be a long hold. If you&#39;ve ever done shrooms or molly, you know what it&#39;s like, you shouldn&#39;t need convincing to invest.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>that should be your DD</strong></p>\n\n<p>then i found the mindmed subreddit where i met mere Gods amongst mortals posting price targets, DD&#39;s, Quality Memes. Things i look at and pretend i know what they mean. I knew i found my home, and all the posts further reinforced my conviction in this company. I just hid there lurking since before 1000 members. i&#39;ve been up hugely, i&#39;ve been down hugely as well.</p>\n\n<p>The one intangible thing i can&#39;t shake is the gut feeling that somehow my Autism will prevail, i may have finally weaponized it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The way i look at it is this is my lifes lottery, this is my DFV moment, one attempt to gap up my social class or relegate to being lower middle class for the rest of my life &quot;Get Rich or $ROPE trying &quot; - 50 cent</strong></p>\n\n<p>If i do lose it all, well at least i was invested in something where the goal is the betterment of individuals like me, fellow retards. And i&#39;ll be able to sleep at night knowing that. Also my loss porn will fuel my masturbatory sessions for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>if i had this money in literally any other stock a 10% dip and I&#39;d paperhand and $ROPE but for some reason with $MNMD, it just feels like for once im very very early to something, i always look at shit like $SHOP $TSLA $WEED and go , if only i would have bought x amount back in y ,</p>\n\n<p><strong>pics for proof</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/5R1FsE7\">https://imgur.com/a/5R1FsE7</a></p>\n\n<p>Link to the DD that made me confident i&#39;m in the right company for the right reasons</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzxtz5/mnmd_starter_due_diligence/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link\">https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzxtz5/mnmd_starter_due_diligence/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link</a></p>\n\n<p>🚀🚀🚀to the fucking moon, or back to my parents basement to allow my virginity to grow back and my wizard powers to activate🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0okrr/maxed_out_my_line_of_credit_and_my_life_savings/","title":"Maxed out my line of Credit + and my life savings into $MNMD ​🌝 or ​👉​👌","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"April 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-29T11:50:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-29 11:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n0okrr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0okrr/maxed_out_my_line_of_credit_and_my_life_savings/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0okrr/maxed_out_my_line_of_credit_and_my_life_savings/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"420NoScopeFedoraTip","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/420NoScopeFedoraTip","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"420NoScopeFedoraTip","score":1327,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"クレジットのラインを最大にして＋人生の貯金を$MNMDにしました🌝または👉👌です。","the_new_excerpt":"簡単ですよね。\n\n現在、私は一軒家の地下室を借りていて、2階には4人のルームメイトがいますが、家賃は安いです。\n家賃が安いので、頭金を貯めることができるんです。ここで問題なのは、私はトロントに住んでいるということです。\nカナダです。メスの巣窟ではない一戸建ての家が欲しいなら、次のいずれかの条件が必要です。\n6桁の収入を得ているか、超倹約家であるか、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"把我的信用额度+和我一生的积蓄都用在了MNMD 🌝或👉👌上。","the_new_excerpt":"这很简单。\n\n我目前在一个房子里租了一个地下室，楼上有4个室友，租金很便宜。\n所以我可以攒钱付首付。重点来了，我住在多伦多。\n加拿大。如果你想要一个独立的房子，而不是一个毒品窝点，你需要：:\n赚取6位数，是一个巨大的节俭的嗡嗡声------。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"把我的信用額度+和我一生的積蓄都用在了MNMD 🌝或👉👌上。","the_new_excerpt":"這很簡單。\n\n我目前在一個房子裏租了一個地下室，樓上有4個室友，租金很便宜。\n所以我可以攢錢付首付。重點來了，我住在多倫多。\n加拿大。如果你想要一個獨立的房子，而不是一個毒品窩點，你需要：:\n賺取6位數，是一個巨大的節儉的嗡嗡聲------。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1387417656446304261","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1387417656446304261","title":"We're going to be reading some variation of this headline until at least 2027 https://t.co/hi9TU2OEtS","date":"April 29, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"少なくとも2027年までは、この見出しのバリエーションを読み続けることになるだろう。https://t.co/hi9TU2OEtS","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"至少在2027年之前，我们都会读到这个标题的一些变体https://t.co/hi9TU2OEtS。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"至少在2027年之前，我們都會讀到這個標題的一些變體https://t.co/hi9TU2OEtS。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-n12w23","excerpt":"In the midst of the earnings season, we should be more interested in how the\ncompany is actually performing, not just staring blindly at the stock’s reaction\nto the results.\n\nIf a company shows good financial performance and provides positive news, you\nshould be happy.
