Every day I&#39;ve been tracking GME and got really close to selling, but before I sold, I decided study <a href=\"/u/deepfuckingvalue\">u/deepfuckingvalue</a> activity for insights into why GME. I found a comment about that locked me in and want to discuss with you retards.</p>\n\n<p>The news screams at us that the market is over valued. Time and time again a company has $40bn market cap on a measly $2bn revenue with $500mm profits. Who in their right minds would say a company is worth $40bn when it would take 80 years to see ROI. OVER VALUED TRASH. Even UBER report billions in losses but institutional investors are still riding a wave on overvalued trash, why shouldn&#39;t we do the same? </p>\n\n<p>GME is a good buy compared to loads of other OVER VALUED trash on the market. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>People talk up the demise of GameStop yet here they are about to generate over $2b in revs in a single quarter at the tail end of a console cycle. - <a href=\"/u/deepfuckingvalue\">u/deepfuckingvalue</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>$2bn in revenue in a quarter is not bad. In 2020, GME had revenues of $6.5bn with $300mm in losses down from $8.3 revenue with $491mm in losses in 2019--their worst year since each year before they were turning a profit. Amid a global pandemic GME manages to hold onto revenue and contain losses, they even came close to a profit in Q420 with only $20mm in losses down from $84mm in Q419--amid a global pandemic with Q420 ending in October and not including holiday sales.</p>\n\n<p>Look at UBER and SNAP. In 2020, UBER had $14.15bn in revenue AND $8.6 BILLION IN LOSSES yet currently $113bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. Or SNAP. In 2020 it had $2.5bn in revenue, $945mm in losses and currently has $94bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. </p>\n\n<p>If GME is over valued trash like these smart buys then it must be valued at $100bn, maybe $50bn. But wait, GME market cap rests at a modest $3.4bn. WTF?? So you mean to say GME&#39;s revenues are 2x its stock market value while closing in on losses but UBER and SNAP are killer buys with $100bn market cap with no end to their bleeding $$. THE EXPERTS SAY ITS BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL!!!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The “shift to digital” thesis is way overblown. - <a href=\"/u/deepfuckingvalue\">u/deepfuckingvalue</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The financial news screams at us saying digital has killed brick in mortar, blah blah blah, we live inside computers now--see PROOF we are on WSB ALL DAY!! If brick and mortar were dead then why would Amazon purchase Whole Foods? Why do companies like PELOTON have retail stores ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY? Why did e-commerce sales only represent 11% of all retail sales in the US in 2019? BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL IS WAY OVERBLOW BULLSHIT THEY FEED US.</p>\n\n<p>GME has losses, sure, but they are containing costs with revenue exceeds their entire stock market value. GME is bringing in loads of $$ and their nearly contained losses are way under leading trash-buy stocks like UBER and SNAP. Brick and mortar is alive even in a pandemic--just wait until after the pandemic. People like to visit shops and get their buy on quickly--that&#39;s why AMZ bought Whole Foods and online retail only represents a fraction of brick and mortar retail sales. GME is not going anywhere anytime soon. GME is undervalued compared to the rest of the trash on the overvalued market. That&#39;s why I&#39;m holding, will stop looking at the ticker price, and will no longer join in discussion about GME on WSB. </p>\n\n<p>See you all in the summer of 21   ✋💎🤚 </p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice. I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about.
