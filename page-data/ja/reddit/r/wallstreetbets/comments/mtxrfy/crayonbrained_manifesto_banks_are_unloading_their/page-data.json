A passively managed account <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-portfolio-management.asp\">explained by investopedia here</a> means the bank or institution will invest your savings <del>as they choose</del> instead of you having full control:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Passive portfolio management mimics the investment holdings of a particular index in order to achieve similar results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This gives them a lot of leeway, but people trust that big banks have the smartest minds managing funds, and &quot;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp\">fiduciary obligations</a>&quot; will require them to use those minds to act in my best interests, right??</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3erffg0840u61.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24524b7948798f4698b338a66b6903787417dad4\">from investopedia</a></p>\n\n<p>Well, over the past 4 months of intense brain wrinkling, I learned that many brilliant minds think that a market crash is unavoidable in the near future. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1362635795052421123\">As he states here,</a> <strong>Dr. Brrrrry believes that a market crash is inevitable, inflation will happen, and both b$tco$n and gold will suffer due to governments directly competing with them for currency.</strong>  <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/01/the-feds-tipsy-portfolio-and-inflation-expectations/amp/?__twitter_impression=true\">He linked to an article here on TIPS,</a> &quot;treasury inflation-protected securities.&quot; It explains that they may not be safe from inflation after all <em>and</em> the Fed is buying up almost all of what the Treasury is issuing.  <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm\">About 1/5th of <strong>ALL</strong> U.S. dollars currently in existence were printed last year</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/1381/debt-to-gdp-ratio-historical-chart\">debt-to-GDP ratio is near its historical high</a>, having jumped from 107% to 129% <em>in the last year alone.</em>  That&#39;s <em>as big of an increase as 2009-2020</em>- all in the last year.  <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics\">Margin debt carried by big banks</a> is up almost double from last year and near historical highs, and that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.  The <a href=\"https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities/index-quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities.html\">Q4 Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives Activities</a> shows the big banks are currently trading, mainly with derivatives bought on margin debt....</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3f7xtrvu53u61.png?width=1472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=732cd63bb568a8e4e81c952317e90aaf83a45572\">appendix table 1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/agtwece763u61.png?width=1543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4471c8aed1b613dab4c18b85f5a84e8624b698\">appendix table 2</a></p>\n\n<p>Reading is really hard so I had to use my crayons, but that says banks own over $163 <strong>T</strong>rillion in derivatives based on $19 Trillion of assets, and <em>Holding Companies</em> own over $218 <strong>T</strong>rillion in derivatives based on $17 Trillion of assets.  <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/\">Check out an infographic on all of the world&#39;s money here</a> if you want, I can&#39;t add that high.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Brrrry posted the following chart on investments that have historically protected one from inflation by rising in value directly proportional to amount of inflation, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859\">source:</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u1w385nmm2u61.png?width=466&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87e6dd430dc6b9dbfbac68f0d1e44766ed703c97\">ApespeeK: dollar go down, bond go down, these go up.  (See note above about gold.)</a></p>\n\n<p>The Q4 filings showing what Warren Buffet has been up to convinced me that all of this is real, <a href=\"https://www.dataroma.com/m/m_activity.php?m=BRK&amp;typ=a\">summarized on this webpage.</a>  Buffet, the guy who says &quot;our favorite holding period is forever&quot; and has always loved bank stocks, just sold huge amounts of stock- 100% out of some positions- here are some of the biggest sells:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9d9ua5ca93u61.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88fd4de36663175e21bd70c942b23ede418e2f68\">Q4</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ooiemmz1a3u61.png?width=660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=674ca1036be24e6900d23064d6cfa67ea4a9873d\">Q3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qhcf3wq9a3u61.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67d9ee0611b537a04349c50e00e2428c98f13208\">Q2</a></p>\n\n<p>He made some very significant buys as well:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lf5lijkpa3u61.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a956765545f46dc863330d55f5262ecae077d24\">Q3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yr30x7gva3u61.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3274afb8db2c492103c9b7b0ff6bdf3b4120d16\">Q4</a></p>\n\n<p>His buys match up nearly perfectly with things that rise in value along with inflation according to Dr. Brrrrry&#39;s table.  His sells match up nearly perfectly with all the banks and companies that will suffer if Brrrry&#39;s thesis about debt bubble bursting + inflation is correct.  <em>Including selling off 100% of his position in gold.</em></p>\n\n<h1>fuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkk.</h1>\n\n<p>Biases fully confirmed, I called my parents to warn them of things to come. My experience was unsettling- I learned that their retirement savings were in passively managed accounts through large institutions.  My mom had chosen how &quot;risky&quot; she wanted her investments to be- she chose a 50/50 plan, she said- and let the institution allocate accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out her investments are in 60% stocks, <strong>40% bonds.</strong>  My dad has even more in bonds than that.  I realize that this is a very common investment strategy for retirement funds, and in most markets provides a dependable, unchanging amount of money back-per-investment.</p>\n\n<p>Dependable, unless you&#39;re concerned about a market crash, inflation, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/flood-of-new-debt-tests-bond-market-11615372201\">major dilution of the bonds market.</a></p>\n\n<h1>BONDS WILL NOT PROTECT INVESTMENTS AGAINST INFLATION.  BONDS DEPRECIATE 1:1 WITH THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR.</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com.hk/en/start-investing/learn-about-investing/bond-investing-made-simple/how-interest-rates-affect-bonds\">This Hong Kong fidelity website does a surprisingly nice job of explaining this further.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>&quot;Often called the ‘enemy of the bond investor’, rising inflation erodes the value of bonds and makes their coupon payments less appealing, if interest rates remain constant or rise.&quot;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I then learned that my <em>husband&#39;s</em> parents employ an independent financial advisor, paid on commission based on their fund&#39;s performance.  That advisor had moved his parents&#39; funds <em>almost entirely out of bonds,</em> <strong><em>and started doing so over four years ago.</em></strong>  Neither of his parents work any more- they&#39;re entirely dependent on that money for the rest of their lives- it&#39;s not something they would take any risks with.  Knowing that, their advisor <em>still</em> made this move <em>and</em> went so far as to give his parents a book, <a href=\"https://prezi.com/nwnd3jgtqff5/be-an-owner-not-a-loaner/\">&quot;Be an Owner, Not a Loaner&quot;</a>, explaining the difference between how bonds and stocks would retain value based on current market conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Yet here were <em>my</em> parents, having chosen low levels of risk, having their money being invested in <strong><em>40%+ in bonds.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>If you check out <a href=\"https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/retirement-insights/guide-to-retirement/\">J.P. Morgan&#39;s retirement guide here,</a> they actually recommend a portfolio of <strong>60% bonds</strong> if you have &quot;medium-term goals&quot; like college or home loans.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hls1v5gxc3u61.png?width=493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17cef635a9c36e4de89e239aee4baf7997723298\">from JP&#39;s retirement guide</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/fund-literature/brochure/brochure-model-portfolio.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n\">Goldman Sach&#39;s retirement guide</a> is similar, explaining that the lowest-risk portfolios are those with the most money into bonds.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qebo1tyhd3u61.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf99f39a01eb55e1df19a17e42dcebee18fcefb5\">\\&quot;Fixed Income\\&quot; refers to money allocated to bonds</a></p>\n\n<p>So.... according to the sacks at Sachs, my husband&#39;s retired parents have their money in the &quot;highest risk&quot; portfolio possible.  Which doesn&#39;t make sense based on everything I know and have linked above, <em>especially</em> if there&#39;s a debt bubble about to burst, and one good catalyst could trigger it.</p>\n\n<p>Then I happen to see this news posted: <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/goldman-sachs-bank-america-jpmorgan-bonds-dividends-51618602441\"><strong>3 big banks hold largest bond sales ever this week.</strong></a>  Bank of america sold $15 billion worth, JP Morgan sold $13 billion worth, and Goldman Sachs sold $6 billion.  <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/jpmorgan-to-sell-13-billion-of-bonds-in-largest-bank-sale-ever\">This Bloomberg article goes on to explain:</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yp9ofzjhp3u61.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82c7c33b46c031c43f0139b68583b06722dd75ed\">https://preview.redd.it/yp9ofzjhp3u61.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82c7c33b46c031c43f0139b68583b06722dd75ed</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/fed-to-end-covid-19-capital-break-it-granted-wall-street-banks\">This bloomberg article goes further into the &quot;capital break&quot;</a> that&#39;s now expired.

If it&#39;s true that \\&quot;where there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire,\\&quot; does that ALSO mean \\&quot;where there&#39;s gas, there&#39;s bullshit\\&quot;??  Discuss.</a></p>\n\n<p>Which led me to remember <em>THIS</em> fun little list from the <a href=\"https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities/files/pub-derivatives-quarterly-qtr4-2020.pdf\">Q4 banking derivatives statement</a>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bk7chzmiw3u61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2f6ad09c24f6a9543c65ce7f281db712802d44a\">SACKS</a></p>\n\n<p>Strong correlation between debt over-exposure and the banks that Warren Buffet sold 100% of.  So- why are banks rapidly unloading debt while <strong><em>clearly</em></strong> over-leveraged to debt while <strong><em>keeping</em></strong> debt in their <em>&quot;low-risk&quot;</em> retirement funds?  Fiduciary responsibility my ass...</p>\n\n<h1>TLDR: make your own conclusions based on the facts above.
