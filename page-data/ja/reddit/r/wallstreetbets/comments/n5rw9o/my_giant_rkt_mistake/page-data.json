If you bought calls, you are not alone. I went all in on calls. When I say all in, I mean I have less than $100 left in my bank account... all in. I don’t have a lot of money, but I truly believed RKT had to go up. I had $17,000 (my entire savings + checking) in calls and I’m sure tomorrow they will be practically worthless. I have a baby coming in 3 weeks and now I have to tell my wife I lost all our money. After I had done fairly well the past few months on stocks, she was confident in me and allowed me to do this. I still believe RKT is a great company and their results are incredible. I still believe it’s hugely undervalued. But none of that matters now. I’ve learned a very hard lesson and will never buy calls again, and will probably leave the market alone for quite a while completely while I try to get back on my feet. I was so confident in RKT I didn’t see it as a gamble, but it was all along. And I lost it all. I realize for most of you on here $17,000 isn’t a lot. But for me it was. It was literally everything.  I know I made a mistake so please save the harsh words.  I feel terrible enough already.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: yes I recommended others buy shares and not calls. Because I realized I made a huge mistake and was trying to convince other people not to gamble like I did. I saw the price action and realized the calls were screwed</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5rw9o/my_giant_rkt_mistake/","title":"My giant RKT mistake.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"May 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-06T03:33:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-06 03:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n5rw9o","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5rw9o/my_giant_rkt_mistake/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5rw9o/my_giant_rkt_mistake/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"BigDaddyJ_Stocks","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BigDaddyJ_Stocks","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"BigDaddyJ_Stocks","score":2043,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"私の巨大なRKTのミス。","the_new_excerpt":"私のようにRKTが上昇すると思って買った人は、コールではなく株を買ったことを願っています。\nコールではなく株を買ったことを願う。コールを買った人は、あなただけではありません。私はコールに全力で取り組みました。\n全額投資と言っても、私の銀行口座には100ドル以下しか残っていませんが...全部です。\nでした。私は大金を持っていませんが、RKTが持っていると心から信じていました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我的巨大RKT错误。","the_new_excerpt":"如果有人像我一样买了RKT，认为它将上涨，我希望你买的是股票而不是看涨期权。\n而不是看涨期权。如果你买了看涨期权，你并不孤单。我全额买入了看涨期权。\n当我说全押时，我的意思是我的银行账户里只剩下不到100美元......全押。\n入。我没有很多钱，但我真的相信RKT有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的巨大RKT錯誤。","the_new_excerpt":"如果有人像我一樣買了RKT，認爲它將上漲，我希望你買的是股票而不是看漲期權。\n而不是看漲期權。如果你買了看漲期權，你並不孤單。我全額買入了看漲期權。\n當我說全押時，我的意思是我的銀行賬戶裏只剩下不到100美元......全押。\n入。我沒有很多錢，但我真的相信RKT有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n5vldf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5vldf/holdgme/","title":"HOLDGME","date":"May 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"HOLDGME","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"HOLDGME","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"HOLDGME","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-n5uz1x","excerpt":"Maybe I am biased because I love Marvel but Disney+ already surpassed 100+\nsubscribers within less than 2 years since it launched.
