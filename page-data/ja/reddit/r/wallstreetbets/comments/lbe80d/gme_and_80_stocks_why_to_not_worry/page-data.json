The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point! It&#39;s over!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wrong.</p>\n\n<p>No one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don&#39;t know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it&#39;s not enough. Say it with me:</p>\n\n<p><em>PRICE DOESN&#39;T MATTER</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>WHAT?!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.</p>\n\n<p>They don&#39;t need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that&#39;s the only market activity, it&#39;s a &quot;30 cent stock&quot; but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still fucked. <em>They aren&#39;t buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that&#39;s their problem.</em> It&#39;s an availability issue. Sometimes it&#39;s ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it&#39;s the availability.</p>\n\n<p>All the activity driving down the listed share price are <em>illegal ladder attacks</em> (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren&#39;t actual sales though, it&#39;s just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren&#39;t gobbling up value. These people don&#39;t admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). <em>You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.</em> We aren&#39;t talking about a few shares they need to buy, we&#39;re talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:</p>\n\n<p><em>PRICE DOESN&#39;T MATTER</em></p>\n\n<p>So let&#39;s say you want to buy 50 million shares, let&#39;s look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:</p>\n\n<p><strong># of Shares - Price</strong></p>\n\n<p>x 20 - $0.30c</p>\n\n<p>x 80 - $5</p>\n\n<p>x 400 - $20</p>\n\n<p>x 600 - $40</p>\n\n<p>x 900 - $60</p>\n\n<p>x 2,000 - $100</p>\n\n<p>x 5,000 - $150</p>\n\n<p>x 10,000 - $200</p>\n\n<p>x 30,000 - $300</p>\n\n<p>x 50,000 - $400</p>\n\n<p>x 150,000 - $500</p>\n\n<p>x 1 mil - $1,000</p>\n\n<p>x 15 mil - $5,000</p>\n\n<p>x 30 mil - $69,420</p>\n\n<p>Get it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you&#39;ve bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you&#39;re back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. <em>A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices</em>. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn&#39;t mean anyone&#39;s shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There&#39;s no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.</p>\n\n<p>Get it?</p>\n\n<p><em>PRICE DOESN&#39;T MATTER</em></p>\n\n<p>They need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are &#39;winning&#39; or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn&#39;t a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you&#39;ll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t financial advice, I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbe80d/gme_and_80_stocks_why_to_not_worry/","title":"GME and $80 Stocks.
