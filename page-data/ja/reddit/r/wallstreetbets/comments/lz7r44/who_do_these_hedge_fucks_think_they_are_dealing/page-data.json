Some of us yolo OTM weeklies ON FUCKING <strong>THURSDAYS</strong> and haven&#39;t held shares since we crawled out of our mama&#39;s tummy. We&#39;ve been grinding through endless challenges and impossible video games since before our collective balls dropped for literally nothing but bragging rights. Now, real money is on the table for our struggles and I can&#39;t wait to taste the sweet sweet tears of the soon to be broke-ass hedge fund douche-nozzles who thought scaring us with a little red was going to save them. What they didn&#39;t count on was the simple fact that <strong>WE EAT LOSSES FOR BREAKFAST</strong> AND <strong>BUYING THE DIP</strong> IS OUR <strong>GO TO</strong> <strong>PANIC MOVE</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>To all you gay bears in training combing through our posts: First off, I hope you&#39;ve learned that when you think you&#39;re smarter than the internet, you end up with buckets of $CUM. Secondly, I hope you have some savings because your employers are about to go bankrupt... It&#39;s time to switch to plan B. I&#39;ll be glad to support you with all my GME tendies by letting you get on your knees and prove your worth on whatever street corner your wife&#39;s boyfriend lets you work when you&#39;re not locked in his basement.</p>\n\n<p>Rant over</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thanks for the awards guys!
