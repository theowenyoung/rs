If this is true it only leaves 30 million shares to be traded on the market, but this is greatly reduced because of the Gamma squeeze on Friday. Due to the amount of calls that ended up ITM (all of them) roughly 10-15 million shares will be tied up until Tuesday according to other other DD I saw posted here tonight. </p>\n\n<p>Why is this important? This leaves roughly 15-20 million shares actively trading which is an extremely small float for the volume. This will make any moves far more extreme than usual. This is further reduced by the 💎 ✋ 🐂 here who own approximately 8-10% of shares this amounts to about 7 million shares. If we assume half of us will not sell Monday and provide liquidity, there will be 11.5-16.5 million shares being traded. </p>\n\n<p>Any price movement will be extreme Monday higher or lower. News can swing this stock into triple digits or back down to 20$(extreme example not going to happen).  So if shorts get margin called Monday expect the price to accelerate rapidly higher.  There is also the possibility of another gamma ramp up if too many retards buy far OTM calls, but dealers will likely have something up there sleeve to prevent a repeat of Friday </p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice in any way.\nI also have a long position of 130 shares at 18$ cost basis. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3q7gi/expect_more_volatility_for_gme_on_monday/","title":"Expect more volatility for GME on Monday","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T14:10:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 14:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l3q7gi","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3q7gi/expect_more_volatility_for_gme_on_monday/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3q7gi/expect_more_volatility_for_gme_on_monday/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Haha-100","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Haha-100","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Haha-100","score":1323,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"预计周一GME会有更大的波动。","the_new_excerpt":"感谢这里所有的帖子，我得出的结论是，周一将有。\n浮动量极小，因此波动性也大得多。\n\n这是因为我曾见过一个帖子，实际的浮动幅度远低于\n以7000万股中的3000万股惨淡报收。如果这是真的，它\n只是","locale":"zh"},{"title":"預計週一GME會有更大的波動。","the_new_excerpt":"感謝這裏所有的帖子，我得出的結論是，週一將有。\n浮動量極小，因此波動性也大得多。\n\n這是因爲我曾見過一個帖子，實際的浮動幅度遠低於\n以7000萬股中的3000萬股慘淡報收。如果這是真的，它\n只是","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lc33fl","excerpt":"The Price-Value Feedback Loop: A Look at GME and AMC!\n[http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2021/02/the-price-value-feedback-loop-look-at.html]\n\nHis YouTube video.\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDjw9IB8zvs&feature=emb_logo]\n\nBlogpost and YouTube video by Aswath Damodaran who teaches corporate…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lc33fl/how_gme_and_amc_can_benefit_from_soaring_stock/","title":"How $GME and $AMC can benefit from soaring stock prices.
