He is a senior senior senior executive with the firm. </p>\n\n<p>Im a working dude, I make like 40k a year if that. This guy has the amazing house with the ocean views, the yacht, the small plane, the holiday house - all of it.   </p>\n\n<p>When I was hanging out with him I really wanted to dig down into investing, as he has been doing it all his life and has been very successful at it.  It was an incredibly awkward conversation and he simply did not want to engage at all - and told me that investments should only be done by firms like his and that normal people like me should pay fees for firms like his to invest money. </p>\n\n<p>It started to click with me that there are thousands of fund managers just like him around the world shit scared that people like us take our own future into our own hands, and wont pay their fees. They are terrified that they are going to lose control of the game they have rigged against the working class for 50+ years.   </p>\n\n<p>You could see it today on CNBC - fund managers screaming and having tantrums that little guys that make an hourly wage could trade options and make a few months rent in a day. </p>\n\n<p>They are fucking terrified of this new generation that can trade with confidence from an app on their phone, and make decent money if they are willing to put some risk and time in learning into it.   </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t let these mother fuckers take your money, don&#39;t let the fear they have cloud your judgment. This  last 12 months has been a turning point for millions of people who bought stocks or options for the first time in their life, and realised its not as scary as they were told by &quot;the professionals&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>500 GME @ 70.21. Fuck Melvin Capital for trying to rattle the newbies today.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4xxjm/they_dont_want_you_to_win_my_experience_with_wall/","title":"They dont want you to win - my experience with Wall St firms.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T03:56:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 03:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l4xxjm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4xxjm/they_dont_want_you_to_win_my_experience_with_wall/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4xxjm/they_dont_want_you_to_win_my_experience_with_wall/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Technical_Challenge","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Technical_Challenge","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Technical_Challenge","score":36331,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"他们不想让你赢--我在华尔街公司的经验。","the_new_excerpt":"只是简单的讲述一下华尔街一些心理变态者的心理和\n为什么梅尔文与WSB的事情比你意识到的要大。\n\n我的大舅舅在Pimco工作--它是一家全球性的投资公司，管理着超过1.9\nPimco是一家全球投资公司，管理着超过1.9万亿（是的，有T）的资产和证券。他是一个\n高级...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"他們不想讓你贏--我在華爾街公司的經驗。","the_new_excerpt":"只是簡單的講述一下華爾街一些心理變態者的心理和\n爲什麼梅爾文與WSB的事情比你意識到的要大。\n\n我的大舅舅在Pimco工作--它是一家全球性的投資公司，管理着超過1.9\nPimco是一家全球投資公司，管理着超過1.9萬億（是的，有T）的資產和證券。他是一個\n高級...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lczt22","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lczt22/how_i_feel_buying_another_15_gme_shares_after_a/","title":"How I feel buying another 15 GME shares after a hater called me dumb for holding","date":"February 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我的感觉是，在一个仇敌骂我持股愚蠢之后，我又买了15只GME的股票","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的感覺是，在一個仇敵罵我持股愚蠢之後，我又買了15只GME的股票","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ld0ykd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld0ykd/who_is_still_holding/","title":"WHO IS STILL HOLDING? 💎🙌🚀","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"谁还在持有？💎🙌🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰還在持有？💎🙌🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l4xxjm","previousId":"RedditPost-lczt22","nextId":"RedditPost-ld0ykd","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4xxjm/they_dont_want_you_to_win_my_experience_with_wall/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
