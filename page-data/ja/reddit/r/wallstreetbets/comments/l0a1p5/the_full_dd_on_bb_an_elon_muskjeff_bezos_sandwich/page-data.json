Smart move my fellow degens 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 strap in, cause you&#39;re in for a ride to the moons of fucking pluto.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR Blackberry/AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022. EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn&#39;t fucking matter. It 🚀 will 🚀 be 🚀 in 🚀 every 🚀 single 🚀 one 🚀 Oh, and Blackberry QNX Neutrinos RTOS is fun too.</p>\n\n<p>Before you start reading, I&#39;d suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I&#39;m about to drop a fucking novel.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ve probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you&#39;re wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it&#39;s been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I&#39;ll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.</p>\n\n<p>So why haven&#39;t we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there&#39;s so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it&#39;s just been used to turn on your car&#39;s radio. <em>But things have changed now.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Zombie cars and QNX</strong></p>\n\n<p>QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. <em>What the fuck does that even mean nerd?</em> For anyone like me who&#39;s not a software genius, I&#39;ve done some research so we all know what we&#39;re getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn&#39;t exactly anything that&#39;s significantly more important than the others. However, when you&#39;re using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.</p>\n\n<p>Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn&#39;t develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot <em>program</em> but not their own OS. So who&#39;s OS are they using?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGWdfOT_GLnUXiZBQr4m4lDr6V0nzG6pkRMU6WLRNhsLRKDJHY4MAwxHb-HWZr3pDmEfBYyleSgqSAIjoeXMqU6MfKVSgBbWY5t8brOzZ61dAfzBMOQezOwKfHLLecBdHNEqSjqSskM_c-uUKa-IndxUGWi_Ay9pQMD4kj0iDqvI\">SONY?</a> Blackberry QNX. <a href=\"https://www.chinapev.com/baidu/baidu-and-blackberry-unite-to-integrate-qnx-system-in-apollo-platform/\">Baidu?</a> QNX baby. <a href=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-08-26/washed-up-phone-maker-blackberry-provides-autonomous-vehicle-safety-system-to-xpeng-101597348.html\">XPENG?</a> Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you&#39;ll see XPEV is using DESAY&#39;s autopilot program that&#39;s built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? <a href=\"https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974\">Li Auto</a> But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using <a href=\"https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform\">Nvidia</a> DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There&#39;s no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both <a href=\"https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles\">Canoo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform\">Hyundai</a> makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. <em>But even if they did... it doesn&#39;t even matter.</em></p>\n\n<p>You might have noticed that I didn&#39;t mention Tesla at all. That&#39;s because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Linux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s right. <em>Motherfucking zombie cars</em>. You know that scene in &quot;Fate of the Furious&quot; where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won&#39;t just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.</p>\n\n<p>You know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won&#39;t get it, but you can read <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/\">u/josh_moworld</a>&#39;s post right <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/\">here</a> to get a better idea Blackberry&#39;s history with the U.S. government and security.</p>\n\n<p>The best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you&#39;re pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let&#39;s move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry&#39;s return to the throne 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p><strong>Blackberry x AWS IVY</strong></p>\n\n<p>IVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That&#39;s right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen 👑👑👑</p>\n\n<p>So what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle&#39;s DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car&#39;s wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.</p>\n\n<p>IVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer&#39;s car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer&#39;s interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.</p>\n\n<p>But you know which industry would <em>love</em> this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla&#39;s that had auto pilot. They didn&#39;t know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.</p>\n\n<p>Best part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn&#39;t an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.</p>\n\n<p>For me, I&#39;m long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I&#39;ve looked all over the internet and I can&#39;t find any. And honestly, Blackberry&#39;s security suite has so much to offer this isn&#39;t even the complete DD. I&#39;ve just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0a1p5/the_full_dd_on_bb_an_elon_muskjeff_bezos_sandwich/","title":"The Full DD on $BB: An Elon Musk+Jeff Bezos sandwich for our Supreme Leader John Chen","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-19T08:23:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-19 08:23","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l0a1p5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0a1p5/the_full_dd_on_bb_an_elon_muskjeff_bezos_sandwich/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0a1p5/the_full_dd_on_bb_an_elon_muskjeff_bezos_sandwich/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/8s5JfSipEY2L9fgv5joMLzgEEvzOqs7UJFbjW7igC-M.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b5f1a46be046fcaae65e8dfecd10d68d94aae2a6","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"justaneverydaylife","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/justaneverydaylife","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"justaneverydaylife","score":2218,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"巴恩斯B上的完整DD：埃隆-马斯克+杰夫-贝佐斯的三明治，给我们的最高领导人陈俊杰。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，你买了巴恩斯B在11美元前市场周五。聪明的举动，我的同胞degens\n\n\n冥王星。\n\nTL;DR黑莓/AWS IVY将在2022年后生产的每一辆车。电动车\n或ICE，自动驾驶或潮人驾驶，它不他妈的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"巴恩斯B上的完整DD：埃隆-馬斯克+傑夫-貝佐斯的三明治，給我們的最高領導人陳俊傑。","the_new_excerpt":"所以，你買了巴恩斯B在11美元前市場週五。聰明的舉動，我的同胞degens\n\n\n冥王星。\n\nTL;DR黑莓/AWS IVY將在2022年後生產的每一輛車。電動車\n或ICE，自動駕駛或潮人駕駛，它不他媽的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l9e8k4","excerpt":"Counterfeiting stock is the single most significant fraud in the financial\nindustry and at the source of the GME movement.\n\nA lot of the issues, naked shorts, ladder attacks and market manipulations are\nenabled by counterfeiting stocks.\n\nSome users are speculating that there are well in excess of…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l9e8k4/how_hedge_funds_counterfeit_stock/","title":"How Hedge Funds Counterfeit Stock","date":"January 31, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对冲基金如何伪造股票","the_new_excerpt":"伪造股票是金融领域最主要的一种欺诈行为。\n业，也是金交所运动的源头。\n\n很多问题，赤裸裸的空头，阶梯式的攻击和市场操纵是\n由造假股促成。\n\n有网友猜测，有远超...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對沖基金如何僞造股票","the_new_excerpt":"僞造股票是金融領域最主要的一種欺詐行爲。\n業，也是金交所運動的源頭。\n\n很多問題，赤裸裸的空頭，階梯式的攻擊和市場操縱是\n由造假股促成。\n\n有網友猜測，有遠超...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l9fabu","excerpt":"Understanding the VW Infinity Squeeze\n\n * Prior to 2008 (VW Infinity Squeeze) Porsche was a significant shareholder in\n   VW.\n * October 2008 Porsche took its stake to 30%, then 50%.
