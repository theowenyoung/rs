I doubt that anything will acruallly come of this, but now real heat is coming out, as tends to when traditional power dynamics are upset. </p>\n\n<p>Not to mention; despite the fact that he was acting as a private individual and not actually acting in an official or financial position, the optics are being set up against him. </p>\n\n<p>Do not attack him if he decides to withdraw all today. He has his own life and family to protect. He’s also much more vulnerable than anyone here, and he doesn’t have the polemical connections like citadel does. Not to mention he just screams boomer bait. </p>\n\n<p>I suspect he’s feeling pressured into not selling because of the cult status he has here. But his own personal life comes first. Chances are, he may never be able to work in an official financial position again. </p>\n\n<p>I’m not crying for his financial future or anything, he’s worth 8 figures. But again, he needs that money given his position. For the rest of his life he will be a political prop. Please respect his decisions and most importantly realize he’s a fucking human being with his own life</p>\n\n<p>Edit: still holding I bought @30 in at $300 lol</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcb614/on_serious_note_respect_the_decisions_of/","title":"On.
