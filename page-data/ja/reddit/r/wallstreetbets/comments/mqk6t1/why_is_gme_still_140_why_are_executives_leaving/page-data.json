For those who did not read the tweet, eliminating debt removes the restricted ability to issue dividends. (they can do it now). At the same time, Gamestop is simultaneously searching for someone well versed in smpyto. I can&#39;t link the articles but it is easily findable online. How does that play into this?</p>\n\n<p>Clearly there are potential uses but the immediate usage may be different. For this we will examine the case of <a href=\"https://overstock.com/\">Overstock.com</a>, ($OSTK) which held a long battle with the shorts. The CEO at the time who apparently had relations with some russian agent, had some vehement anger against the shorts, much as we do except the hedgie intern reading this (btw, shmuck my cmock buddy).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/overstock-soars-amid-flurry-of-short-covering-as-dividend-looms\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/overstock-soars-amid-flurry-of-short-covering-as-dividend-looms</a></p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll need to search for this info yourself as I&#39;m not allowed to post links that have a CERTAIN WORD in the name (smyptmah)</p>\n\n<p>Now, obviously the hedgies don&#39;t accept defeat easily. I mean, we&#39;ve seen every single last ounce of FUD tactic, every illegal shittard strategy. Of course, they tried to SUE overstock -</p>\n\n<p>Which was promptly D E N I E D. Overstock shot up x20 after almost being driven to the ground by shorts (sound familiar?). The CEO sold everything and dunked the price again, whatever.</p>\n\n<p>The concept is simple. Issue a dividend, but in smytpmohdurrensy - to make it legal, it has to be for function of the store, so it&#39;s a gamestop credit. The shorts literally have no way to pay this dividend and must cover. Why tf do you think executives with lucrative positions at successful companies would join a company &quot;WITH A VALUATION OF $12?&quot; BECAUSE ITS NOT $12 ITS THE MOON YOU SHMU-</p>\n\n<p>Note: I am beyond not a financial advisor. I am an absolute dumbass monke. Positions: Fu hedgies I&#39;m not giving you information. I am leveraged to the tits.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Do note that the explosion in overstock price happened WHILE the CEO was going <em>literally</em> batshit crazy. It was a forced price increase. Gamestop is entirely different. There is a horde of people behind this. Even if the original play was for profit and still is, there is now ideals riding behind it. We love Cohen, we love DFV, we love the stock. Add this with a forced price increase of the same level - we&#39;re onto something. Those CEO&#39;s aren&#39;t stupid, and they&#39;re getting paid purely <em>in stock</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqk6t1/why_is_gme_still_140_why_are_executives_leaving/","title":"Why is GME still 140?
