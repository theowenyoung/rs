Not amazing but a respectable 20-30% bull run a week. </p>\n\n<p>I have some research and DD done for them but a bit hesitant to even say the ticker name because of the absolute state of the sub. </p>\n\n<p>I think what happened was a mix of different kinds of people after the GME conflict. Many new users have never seen gain bigger than .04% in their chase savings account, so for them, a gain of 10-20% is absolutely massive and will get out as soon as they realize that gain because “10% is a once in a life time” for them. </p>\n\n<p>Of course this leads to the conflict with the old retards that want to see 10,000% in the call options. And the new will alway win because it’s about 4m to 2m in number here in this sub. </p>\n\n<p>This is not investments. This is a get rich quick scheme. I think this is what’s not being understood by the newer people and what the older people don’t understand about new people. New people treat this sub as investment, gaining 10-20% a day is absolutely amazing. So they take profit and buy dip. Etc. nothing wrong with that. </p>\n\n<p>I also would like to venture that there are definitely hedgfunds (not large but small ones) that have started to ride our the momentum for short term for stocks in this sub. The massive volume in premarket is the first realization of this (I know most of you old retards don’t use anything like actual trading platform beside robinhood so you’re stuck with market days only and I’m guessing 99% of the new retards don’t even know you CAN trade AF and pre market).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhostl/if_you_have_a_stock_thats_doing_well_long_term/","title":"If you have a stock that’s doing well long term- don’t post it here.
