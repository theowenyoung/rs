It reads &quot; A &quot;short squeeze&quot; due to a sudden increase in demand for our class A common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A common stock. Investors may purchase shares of our Class A common stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A common stock may involve long and short exposure. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A common Stock available for our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A common Stock for deliver to lenders of our Class\nA common Stock. Those repurchases, may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A common stock until additional shares of our Class A common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a &quot;short squeeze.&quot; A large proportion of our class a Common Stock ha been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A common stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbqroi/gme_10k_filing_mentions_squeeze/","title":"GME 10~k filing mentions squeeze!","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-24T02:02:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-24 02:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mbqroi","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbqroi/gme_10k_filing_mentions_squeeze/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbqroi/gme_10k_filing_mentions_squeeze/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Mitchy45","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mitchy45","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Mitchy45","score":7342,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"金交所10~k申报中提到挤压!","the_new_excerpt":"编辑 Holy fuck this is real LOL - https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ———————————\n\nGME10K中提到 \"可能会出现短线震荡\"! 他们知道接下来会发生什么!\n\n哇，有人看到了吗？对未来的预测。这是在提交的10K中!\n有什么想法和意见吗？\n\n这是在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"金交所10~k申報中提到擠壓!","the_new_excerpt":"編輯 Holy fuck this is real LOL - https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ———————————\n\nGME10K中提到 \"可能會出現短線震盪\"! 他們知道接下來會發生什麼!\n\n哇，有人看到了嗎？對未來的預測。這是在提交的10K中!\n有什麼想法和意見嗎？\n\n這是在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mss4dd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mss4dd/two_worlds_one_family_apes_strong_together/","title":"TWO WORLDS, ONE FAMILY!
