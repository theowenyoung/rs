I initially bought 75% shares and 25% calls and just pressed buttons on my phone a few times here and then for the next couple months. I didn&#39;t want to post this until GME wounds started healing for others. I did, however, go down with the ship in my Fidelity where I lost about 25k on shares. Nothing I did was smart, I got lucky. DON&#39;T FUCKING GAMBLE WITH MONEY YOU CAN&#39;T AFFORD TO LOSE. THERE WAS 1 SPOT IN 10 MILLION WHERE THAT SHIT ACTUALLY WORKS AND I ALREADY TOOK IT. Please don&#39;t test your luck because you will lose your shirt and your wife will go stay with her boyfriend permanently. Otherwise, keep those Wendie&#39;s Tendies flowing you fucking retards.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 1: Getting a lot of PM&#39;s asking for money. Bitch, I&#39;d love to help everybody and will be making sizeable donation to charities and bringing video games to kids for Christmas. However, I don&#39;t just have cash everywhere. I actually adjusted my quality of life DOWNWARDS. Also, if you wanna PM me to ask where to learn about options, you better have some experience in business, logistics, trucking or brokering freight, so you can return the favor. I need help with something so tit for tat.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Got a lot of people messaging me asking about what shall not be named i.e. rule 4. If you are interested in that, you can go through my post history.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lih2mv/gme_gains_started_with_4500_in_november_15_mil_in/","title":"GME Gains.
