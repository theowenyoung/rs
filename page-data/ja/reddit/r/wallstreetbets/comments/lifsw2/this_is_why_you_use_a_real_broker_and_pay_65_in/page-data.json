One account is with Robinhood (I know, I know, but I&#39;m waiting on options approval with my Fidelity brokerage account) and one account is a Fidelity Traditional IRA where I already have options enabled. I&#39;ve started by buying these contracts on RH and have been paying an average of .14 or even .15 just to get filled. I&#39;ve had a few .13 filled, but the bid in the quote below are my 7 for my Robinhood account. I&#39;m very eager to buy these contracts, so while I wait for that to fill, I started buying on Fidelity in my IRA. As you can see, I bought 91 contracts where I put in a limit order for .15, and Fidelity was able to get them filled at .13. ALL WHILE MY .13 ROBINHOOD ORDER ISN&#39;T FILLING.</p>\n\n<p>I paid $.65 in commission for Fidelity but they are filling, where as I&#39;d have to move my Robinhood order up to .14 or .15 just to fill, costing even more than the Fidelity commission. Holy shit, here&#39;s the proof of just how terrible we&#39;re all getting fucked by Robinhood. It&#39;s been 10 minutes and I&#39;m still waiting on RH to fill. This is unbelievable.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not a financial advisor, and my only advice is to ditch the fuck out of Robinhood ASAP...</p>\n\n<p>200 (193 at this point, fucking RH) 2/19 WKHS $60C</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/xgSVxjR\">https://imgur.com/a/xgSVxjR</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x0pyp7xf83h61.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eeebb8839c73fd6531c3f3a07e4fe9e8add02cb\">https://preview.redd.it/x0pyp7xf83h61.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eeebb8839c73fd6531c3f3a07e4fe9e8add02cb</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: image</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Here&#39;s proof that RH and Fidelity were using the same exchange to fill my orders. Here&#39;s a RH order I made at 11:47 <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/w2ysGFy\">https://imgur.com/a/w2ysGFy</a> and here&#39;s the log of orders where you can see that was filled on the same exchange as my Fidelity orders <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/VH6R6Ek\">https://imgur.com/a/VH6R6Ek</a> They have no excuse of not having access to the same exchange Fidelity was using.
