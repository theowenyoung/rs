Is this not a great opportunity to buy NIO? </p>\n\n<p>January 9th is NIO day so I expect to see a large volume of trading around these dates however I’m in this for the LONG TERM not for a short pump. </p>\n\n<p>Will NIO be similar to Tesla? Will we ever see the price below the $50 mark again? </p>\n\n<p>I’m thinking of putting a lot of hard earned savings into this company but always like to hear others opinions before committing. Please share any further thoughts on NIO.
