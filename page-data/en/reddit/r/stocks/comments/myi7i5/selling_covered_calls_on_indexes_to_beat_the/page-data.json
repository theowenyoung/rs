Even if you do, there is a good chance that the price dips back below the breakeven point at some point, especially if you time CCs with unsustainable spikes.</p>\n\n<p>For example, many indexes had a several week run recently that had at annualized return of over 100%. There is clearly no way that rate is sustainable, so selling CCs on a run like that seems like an attractive strategy. </p>\n\n<p>I realize the percentage return might be small, but once a position gets large enough (likely if you have most of your portfolio in index funds), this strategy can either provide some extra income or can be used as a DRIP to increase shares every month, week, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there certainly are some risks to consider.  If you do lose your shares, you might have to pay short-term capital gains. However, you could always just close or roll the CCs. While this would be a loss, that might be attractive to offset any large short-terms gains you might already have. For example, I had huge gains in January and February. If my index CCs end up ITM, I can close them to offset short-term gains, while still holding my shares for long-term gains.</p>\n\n<p>The other risk of CCs is that you generally have to be willing to hold the shares until expiration, which doesn&#39;t matter for index funds since they are generally held long.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything I&#39;m overlooking? I don&#39;t hear much about this strategy. Normally the advice is &quot;don&#39;t sell CCs on shares you don&#39;t want to lose,&quot; which is good advice, but seems overly restrictive.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR</p>\n\n<p>Selling low-delta CCs on index funds seems like a great way to slightly beat the market. Are there any non-obvious risks with this strategy?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/myi7i5/selling_covered_calls_on_indexes_to_beat_the/","title":"Selling Covered Calls on Indexes to Beat the Market","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-26T19:54:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-26 19:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"myi7i5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/myi7i5/selling_covered_calls_on_indexes_to_beat_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/myi7i5/selling_covered_calls_on_indexes_to_beat_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"qwerty5151","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/qwerty5151","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"qwerty5151","score":39,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"指数のカバードコールを売って市場に勝つ","the_new_excerpt":"長期的に見て、市場に勝てる人はほとんどいないということを示す多くの研究があります。\nそのため、様々なインデックス・ファンドに投資することが一般的には最良の戦略となります。\n\nインデックス・ファンドのファーOTMカバード・コールを売れば、ほとんどの年で市場に勝てる可能性が高くなるのではないでしょうか？\nのカバード・コールを売れば、ほとんどの年で市場に勝てる可能性が高いのではないでしょうか？\n\n確かに、ファーOTMのCCは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"卖出指数的覆盖性看涨期权以战胜市场","the_new_excerpt":"有许多研究表明，从长远来看，几乎没有人能够战胜市场。\n因此，投资于各种指数基金通常是最好的策略。\n\n在指数基金上卖出远期OTM覆盖的看涨期权，难道不会使它在大多数年份有合理的可能性战胜市场吗？\n有可能在大多数年份战胜市场吗？\n\n当然，远端OTM CCs...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"賣出指數的覆蓋性看漲期權以戰勝市場","the_new_excerpt":"有許多研究表明，從長遠來看，幾乎沒有人能夠戰勝市場。\n因此，投資於各種指數基金通常是最好的策略。\n\n在指數基金上賣出遠期OTM覆蓋的看漲期權，難道不會使它在大多數年份有合理的可能性戰勝市場嗎？\n有可能在大多數年份戰勝市場嗎？\n\n當然，遠端OTM CCs...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-myzs3q","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/myzs3q/holding_mvis_since_74_and_ocgn_at_17_then_added/","title":"Holding $MVIS since .74 and $OCGN at 1.7 then added 5,000 more shares over past 2 months","date":"April 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"MVISを0.74から、OCGNを1.7から保有し、過去2ヶ月間で5,000株追加した。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"自0.74美元起持有MVIS，在1.7美元时持有OCGN，然后在过去两个月内增加了5000股。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"自0.74美元起持有MVIS，在1.7美元時持有OCGN，然後在過去兩個月內增加了5000股。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mz3sof","excerpt":"From Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino on Twitter:\n\nBREAKING: Traders says an @amazon stock split is likely in 2021 possibly as\nearly as Thursday when co reports earnings catapulting @JeffBezos significantly\nahead of @elonmusk as the world's richest person as move would allow $AMZN…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mz3sof/amzn_amazon_stock_split/","title":"$AMZN Amazon stock split?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 26, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$AMZN アマゾンの株式分割？","the_new_excerpt":"Fox Businessの上級特派員Charles Gasparino氏のTwitterより。\n\nBREAKING: トレーダーによると、@amazonの株式分割は2021年に行われる可能性があります。\n早ければ木曜日の決算発表時に、@JeffBezosが@elonmuskを抜いて世界一の富豪になるかもしれません。\nこれにより、@JeffBezosは@elonmuskを抜いて世界で最も裕福な人物となり、$AMZN...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"$AMZN 亚马逊股票拆分？","the_new_excerpt":"来自福克斯商业高级记者查尔斯-加斯帕里诺的推特。\n\n爆炸性新闻：交易员称，@amazon的股票分割很可能在2021年进行，可能最早在周四公司发布盈利报告时进行。\n早在周四，当公司发布收益报告时，@JeffBezos就会大幅提升\n领先于@elonmusk成为世界上最富有的人，因为此举将使$AMZN...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$AMZN 亞馬遜股票拆分？","the_new_excerpt":"來自福克斯商業高級記者查爾斯-加斯帕裏諾的推特。\n\n爆炸性新聞：交易員稱，@amazon的股票分割很可能在2021年進行，可能最早在週四公司發佈盈利報告時進行。\n早在週四，當公司發佈收益報告時，@JeffBezos就會大幅提升\n領先於@elonmusk成爲世界上最富有的人，因爲此舉將使$AMZN...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-myi7i5","previousId":"RedditPost-myzs3q","nextId":"RedditPost-mz3sof","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/myi7i5/selling_covered_calls_on_indexes_to_beat_the/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
