There is a 50$ fee to buy the stock on some platforms, others (like Robinhood) might hide that fee.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot put certain calls on this probably due to liquidity (not sure, you tell me).</p>\n\n<p>Note* Trading volumes are high enough that you won’t get trapped should it continue to drop. (But you already knew that).</p>\n\n<p>Note* RR has gone through bankruptcy before, even that hasn’t stopped it. Should it go to that extreme again, it might rebound all the same.</p>\n\n<p>PROs:\nOver the next year it should see a LARGE boost in stock price along with the return to travel culture, if not large, than significant, but I have no crystal ball, however my sentiment is shared by many regarding the aviation future.</p>\n\n<p>The have announced exploration avenues and R&amp;D projects that are in the pipeline.</p>\n\n<p>They have a great brand and can leverage other sectors besides aviation to keep them going.</p>\n\n<p>OVERALL:\nRR comes with risk, but seems like it could be one of the huge rewards out there for the taking in later 2022. it seems positioned to easily 4x. If there is a time to buy it is today or the last few weeks. Let me know what you think, how is your risk assessment? Why would or wouldn’t you pick up RR.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m6k6tj/rolls_royce_future_outlook/","title":"Rolls Royce - Future Outlook","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T10:47:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 10:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m6k6tj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6k6tj/rolls_royce_future_outlook/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6k6tj/rolls_royce_future_outlook/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"DontWantUrSoch","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DontWantUrSoch","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DontWantUrSoch","score":44,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"劳斯莱斯 - 未来展望","the_new_excerpt":"这只股票在过去几周出现了一些值得注意的变动，现在还早。\n从图表上看，但它看起来像一个上升的回归到一些以前的水平的。\n价值。\n\nCONs。我确实看了一下这家公司的债务水平，并不会。\n忽略它。买股票要交50元的手续费，在一些...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"勞斯萊斯 - 未來展望","the_new_excerpt":"這隻股票在過去幾周出現了一些值得注意的變動，現在還早。\n從圖表上看，但它看起來像一個上升的迴歸到一些以前的水平的。\n價值。\n\nCONs。我確實看了一下這家公司的債務水平，並不會。\n忽略它。買股票要交50元的手續費，在一些...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ml90vt","excerpt":"The meme stock scheduled posts will run Mon to Fri and won't be a sticky; you're\nprobably seeing this because automod sent you here or you woke up early Wall St\ntime; good morning!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome traders who just can't help…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ml90vt/rstocks_daily_thread_on_meme_stocks_tuesday_apr/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Thread on Meme Stocks Tuesday - Apr 06, 2021","date":"April 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Thread on Meme Stocks Tuesday - Apr 06, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"ミームストックの予定投稿は月曜から金曜までで、スティッキーではありません。\nあなたがこれを見ているのは、automodがあなたをここに送ったからか、あるいはあなたがウォール・ストリートの時間に早く目が覚めたからでしょう。\ntime; good morning!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nどうしても助けられないトレーダーを歓迎します...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"r/Stocks每日主题：Meme Stocks周二--2021年4月06日。","the_new_excerpt":"备忘录股票预定的帖子将从周一到周五，不会是贴吧，你是。\n可能看到这个是因为automod把你送到了这里，或者你早早的就醒了华尔街。\n时间；早上好\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n欢迎那些只是忍不住的贸易商...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/Stocks每日主題：Meme Stocks週二--2021年4月06日。","the_new_excerpt":"備忘錄股票預定的帖子將從週一到週五，不會是貼吧，你是。\n可能看到這個是因爲automod把你送到了這裏，或者你早早的就醒了華爾街。\n時間；早上好\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n歡迎那些只是忍不住的貿易商...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ml7n4a","excerpt":"Hi - Coinbase have announced their listing on the Nasdaq (Ticker: COIN) on 14th\nApril.
