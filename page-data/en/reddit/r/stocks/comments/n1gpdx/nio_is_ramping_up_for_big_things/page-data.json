(NIO) is announcing the beginning of construction of NeoPark, a smart electric vehicle industry park it is co-developing with the Hefei government, ahead of the Chinese automaker&#39;s quarterly earnings release after the close Thursday. </p>\n\n<p>What Happened: Work on NeoPark has kicked off, Nio said in a Thursday press release.\nThe opening ceremony was attended by several officials from Anhui province, where Hefei is located, as well as William Li, Nio&#39;s founder, chairman and CEO.</p>\n\n<p>Nio&#39;s China headquarters are situated in Hefei. The collaboration agreement with the Hefei municipal government for NeoPark was signed in early February.</p>\n\n<p>NeoPark is conceived as a smart EV industry cluster, encompassing R&amp;D of vehicles, core parts and components and autonomous driving. It was envisioned to evolve as a pioneering innovation chain with global competitiveness and a hub for hundreds of key supporting industries and a highly clustered, full-fledged industry chain, the company said.</p>\n\n<p>The 16,950-acre park features three main function areas — smart manufacturing, R&amp;D and living space, and Eco park. NeoPark will likely contribute to peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality, according to the company.\nThe park, according to company, will accommodate over 10,000 R&amp;D personnel and 40,000 technical workers. It&#39;s expected to have an annual production capacity of 1 million vehicles and 100 GWh. The annual gross output from the park is expected to reach 500 billion yuan ($77.3 billion).\nWhy It&#39;s Important: Nio has embarked on a broad push to drive volumes as it comes up against fierce competition in a crowded EV market. The company has announced innovation in battery technology, charging infrastructure and services, while also announcing new models.</p>\n\n<p>The company confirmed Wednesday that it is setting up operations in Norway, terming it as the first leg of its international expansion.\nThe investment in Neo Park is also seen as a payback from Nio to the Hefei city, which bailed it out with financial assistance when the company was running out of cash in 2019.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/n1gpdx/nio_is_ramping_up_for_big_things/","title":"NIO is ramping up for big things","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-30T01:18:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-30 01:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n1gpdx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n1gpdx/nio_is_ramping_up_for_big_things/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n1gpdx/nio_is_ramping_up_for_big_things/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"someoneUnreadable","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/someoneUnreadable","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"someoneUnreadable","score":477,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"NIOは大きなことに向けて準備を進めている","the_new_excerpt":"NIO Inc.
