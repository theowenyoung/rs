Well probably Button A, but let&#39;s turn to basic probability theory to be precise. Treating it as an expected value problem, we find:</p>\n\n<p>Button A: $10,000 * .5 = $5,000</p>\n\n<p>Button B: $10,000,000 * .00000001% = $.001</p>\n\n<p>Button A is the better choice 100% of the time. If you were given the option, you&#39;d probably press button A.</p>\n\n<p>However, imagine a world where you, making the right choice, chose button A and lost the 50/50 chance and didn&#39;t even win the $10,000. Then, someone steps up right after you, and after thinking for a bit, presses button B thinking it&#39;s the better choice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>He wins.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Confetti flies everywhere, his family is around to congratulate him and tell him how awesome he is. Everyone thinks he&#39;s a genius because hey, he has $10 Million and you have none.</p>\n\n<p>Then there&#39;s you, you went home with nothing. You&#39;re a button A presser and you suck.</p>\n\n<p>Well I&#39;m here to tell you that as a fellow button A presser, you don&#39;t suck, and I&#39;m proud of you.</p>\n\n<p>New investors - you are constantly being tempted to buy into this results oriented-thinking. The thinking that because the <em>result</em> was good you made the right decision.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a reason portfolio managers can be sued for making their clients tons of money, and there&#39;s also a reason professional poker players don&#39;t beat themselves up after a lost hand that was played with Game-Theory Optimal.</p>\n\n<p>However, when it comes to the stock market, it&#39;s almost impossible to know what was the right decision, whether we make or lose money. The only reliable yardstick we have is our long run average, which is where we learn who&#39;s been swimming naked and who&#39;s Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet.</p>\n\n<p>There has obviously been a large influx of new investors flooding to reddit and heading straight to the markets themselves. Some of you are high off your recent gains and are looking for more, others are feeling discouraged after a streak of bad losses.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know what to say to winning and losing other than to treat those imposters the same, and we all can learn from each other that do the research, do the math, and proudly press button A and have our head high even when we lose sometimes making the right decision.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lhbs9l/the_trap_of_resultsoriented_thinking/","title":"The Trap of Results-Oriented Thinking","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T05:27:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 05:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lhbs9l","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhbs9l/the_trap_of_resultsoriented_thinking/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhbs9l/the_trap_of_resultsoriented_thinking/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Relevations","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Relevations","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Relevations","score":615,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"以结果为导向的思维陷阱","the_new_excerpt":"想象一下，你面对两个可以按下的按钮，而你只能是\n按一。\n\n按A键，你有50%的机会赢取一万块钱\n\n按钮B：你有0.00000001%的机会赢得10,000,000美元的奖金\n\n什么是更好的选择？好吧，可能是按钮A，但让我们转向基本的\n概率论要...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以結果爲導向的思維陷阱","the_new_excerpt":"想象一下，你面對兩個可以按下的按鈕，而你只能是\n按一。\n\n按A鍵，你有50%的機會贏取一萬塊錢\n\n按鈕B：你有0.00000001%的機會贏得10,000,000美元的獎金\n\n什麼是更好的選擇？好吧，可能是按鈕A，但讓我們轉向基本的\n概率論要...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lry9hy","excerpt":"I know no one knows for sure, obviously, but what stocks are you most confident\nin?
