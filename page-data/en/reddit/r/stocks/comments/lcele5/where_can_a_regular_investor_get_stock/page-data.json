I used to really enjoy reading DDs on obscure or interesting companies. I loved checking the sub each day because I never knew what new pieces of information I would find. Some of my favorite stocks I found searching through new/hot. With the whole GME fiasco (I like WSB but I like to keep it separate from my actual investments) every single stock market community seems to be exclusively focused on pumps or squeezes or meme stocks and I just want a community to discuss interesting companies and fundamentals. Is there any subreddit people could recommend me for this? I wouldn’t exactly consider myself a value investor but I do look for reasonably valued growth companies.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcele5/where_can_a_regular_investor_get_stock/","title":"Where can a regular investor get stock information on Reddit these days?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T15:42:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 15:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcele5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcele5/where_can_a_regular_investor_get_stock/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcele5/where_can_a_regular_investor_get_stock/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Haigfish","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Haigfish","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Haigfish","score":815,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"现在的普通投资者哪里能在Reddit上获得股票信息？","the_new_excerpt":"我和其他大股民一起成为了这个社区的成员。\n社区在Reddit上已经有几年了。我曾经非常喜欢阅读\n晦涩或有趣的公司的DD。我喜欢每天查看子\n因为我永远不知道我会发现什么新的信息。有些...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"現在的普通投資者哪裏能在Reddit上獲得股票信息？","the_new_excerpt":"我和其他大股民一起成爲了這個社區的成員。\n社區在Reddit上已經有幾年了。我曾經非常喜歡閱讀\n晦澀或有趣的公司的DD。我喜歡每天查看子\n因爲我永遠不知道我會發現什麼新的信息。有些...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lkvzj7","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkvzj7/someone_help_please/","title":"Someone help please 🤯","date":"February 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"谁来帮帮我吧 🤯。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰來幫幫我吧 🤯。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ll2vl1","excerpt":"Palantir 2020 Results:\n\n * $1.1 billion in revenue for full year 2020, up 47% year-over-year\n * $322 million in revenue for Q4 2020, up 40% year-over-year\n * Expects Q1 2021 revenue growth of 45% year-over-year\n\nQ4 EPS $(0.08) Misses $0.02 Estimate, Sales $322.00M Beat $300.74M…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll2vl1/palantir_reports_revenue_growth_of_47_for_full/","title":"Palantir Reports Revenue Growth of 47% for Full Year 2020, Expects Q1 2021 Revenue Growth of 45%","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 16, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Palantir报告2020年全年收入增长47%，预计2021年第一季度收入增长45%。","the_new_excerpt":"Palantir 2020年业绩。\n\n * 2020年全年收入11亿美元，同比增长47%。\n * 2020年第四季度收入3.22亿美元，同比增长40%。\n *预计2021年第一季度收入将同比增长45%。\n\n第四季度EPS(0.08)元低于预期0.02元，销售额3.22亿元胜过3.074亿元...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Palantir報告2020年全年收入增長47%，預計2021年第一季度收入增長45%。","the_new_excerpt":"Palantir 2020年業績。\n\n * 2020年全年收入11億美元，同比增長47%。\n * 2020年第四季度收入3.22億美元，同比增長40%。\n *預計2021年第一季度收入將同比增長45%。\n\n第四季度EPS(0.08)元低於預期0.02元，銷售額3.22億元勝過3.074億元...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lcele5","previousId":"RedditPost-lkvzj7","nextId":"RedditPost-ll2vl1","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcele5/where_can_a_regular_investor_get_stock/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
