Beyond $5, the ratio of Puts to Calls gets slimmer, which will likely lead to better stability as prices rises.</li>\n<li>Today&#39;s option volume was very high for Calls, and 100% of those Calls were covered. I wouldn&#39;t expect much gamma ramping (sudden upward jumps in price) as we go forward.</li>\n<li>Trade volume of shares was ~350 million today. This is significantly lower than the weekly highs which exceeded 1 billion. This is likely why we saw only small movements. There were also quite a few sell-offs as the price reached a high of $5.22.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>____________________________________________________</p>\n\n<h1>Nokia&#39;s Growing Business</h1>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll keep this section short and sweet like I promised.

There is <em>so much more</em> that isn&#39;t listed here. A lot of these new developments will start taking effect in Fiscal Year 2021 and 2022, which can lead to major growth.</p>\n\n<p>__________________________________________________</p>\n\n<h1>Finances Summary</h1>\n\n<p>For a full look at the finances and a comparison with Qualcomm and Ericsson, check out <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l714e7/part_iii_i_want_to_briefly_go_over_nok_financials/\">Part III</a>.

Based on the numbers, it&#39;s pretty apparent how undervalued Nokia is compared to the competition - both of whom boast very similar finances. I again urge you to read <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l714e7/part_iii_i_want_to_briefly_go_over_nok_financials/\">my post</a> on the finances for a better explanation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>____________________________________________________</strong></p>\n\n<h1>TL;DR</h1>\n\n<p>Market sentiment for $NOK is extremely high as we get ready to move into earnings week. Trade volume of shares has gone down, while option volume and open interest has trended upwards. </p>\n\n<p>Financial data and press releases from Nokia indicate that the company is expecting to perform very well in the long term, with an abundance of new business coming in.</p>\n\n<p>I would again encourage you to read my other posts. They all include TL;DRs for the lazy.</p>\n\n<p>________________________________________________</p>\n\n<h1>Disclaimer and my Holdings -</h1>\n\n<p>I currently own 10 of <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK210716C00005000?p=NOK210716C00005000\">these bad boys</a>.
