Market participants continue to digest the sudden unwinding in stocks by a large hedge fund and an elevated Treasury yield.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management’s family office and a so-called “Tiger cub” (the name Wall Street gave to protégés of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a “significant hit” following Archegos Capital’s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can&#39;t, the broker will dump the client&#39;s shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the fear stemming from Archegos’ margin call, new data shows encouraging signs that the economy is recovering.  In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week’s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. Looking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html\"> to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs</a> in March — the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>However, concerns from market participants remained centered on the pace of economic recovery. With the recent passage of more stimulus and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to maintaining accommodative policies in place for the foreseeable future may cause a rapid spike in inflation. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield remains at elevated levels, 1.731% at the time of writing.</li>\n<li>ARK Investment, managed by star-manager Cathie Wood, launched a space-themed ETF today.
