Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola &amp; GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven’t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky3nxo/amazon_stock_price_target_prediction_analysis_dcf/\">HERE</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW\">Nasdaq Composite</a> losing .12%, the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9\">DOW</a> dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market <a href=\"https://ibb.co/r51hS22\">SP500</a> dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm\">VIX</a> rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were <a href=\"https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD\">advancing</a> on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 <a href=\"https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD\">sectors</a> finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/jZW53gf\">underperformers</a>, while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz\">HEAT MAP</a> from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix &amp; Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil &amp; Gas Industry.</p>\n\n<p>We also received the investor sentiment <a href=\"https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY\">survey</a>, which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G\">SP500</a> losing .72% as the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0\">DOW</a> dropped 177 points while the tech heavy <a href=\"https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV\">Nasdaq Composite</a> was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN\">VIX</a> continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc\">week</a> down almost 3%.</p>\n\n<p>We saw again 4 of the 11 <a href=\"https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG\">SECTORS</a> finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on <a href=\"https://ibb.co/grwfwwM\">Friday</a>, with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/vX2mxss\">week</a> down only 1.2%</p>\n\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/GdWj575\">HEAT MAP</a> from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care &amp; Real Estate sectors, while for the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/441kLYw\">WEEK</a>, there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.</p>\n\n<p>On Thursday we also saw <a href=\"https://ibb.co/M7vznm4\">Powell</a> reiterating the point that rates won’t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless <a href=\"https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ\">CLAIMS</a> which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.</p>\n\n<p>Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January <a href=\"https://ibb.co/n38hy4w\">Consumer</a> sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.</p>\n\n<p>We also saw the New York business <a href=\"https://ibb.co/92Rydt9\">activity</a> coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.</p>\n\n<p>Business <a href=\"https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW\">Inventories</a> came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer <a href=\"https://ibb.co/py4bpTn\">prices</a> rose less than expected and retail <a href=\"https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z\">sales</a> fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT\">WEEK</a> we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting <a href=\"https://ibb.co/B2T64dc\">earnings</a> for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.</p>\n\n<p>In some other stock market news, we saw <a href=\"https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0\">Aphria</a> beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while <a href=\"https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7\">Lemonade</a> dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.</p>\n\n<p>We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with <a href=\"https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY\">PETCO</a> popping almost 50% and <a href=\"https://ibb.co/3cGk45W\">POSHMARK</a> more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with <a href=\"https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP\">Churchill</a> Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn’t go through.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C\">Delta</a> Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.</p>\n\n<p>Thursday was capped off my <a href=\"https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV\">Biden&#39;s</a> new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.</p>\n\n<p>The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.</p>\n\n<p>Biden’s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state &amp; local governments worth $350B &amp; $50B in small business grants and loans. </p>\n\n<p>This will probably serve as a starting point and I don’t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It’s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state &amp; local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.</p>\n\n<p>And moving on, Friday we saw <a href=\"https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm\">Tesla&#39;s</a> forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla <a href=\"https://ibb.co/1Qws23d\">Model Y</a> has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast <a href=\"https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk\">Nikola</a> seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of <a href=\"https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq\">GameStop</a> who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don’t have a good fundamental basis.</p>\n\n<p>So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the <a href=\"https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W\">WORLD</a> markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden’s pick Janet Yellen’s <a href=\"https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b\">remarks</a> on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US <a href=\"https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq\">FUTURES</a> are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you everyone for reading🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!
