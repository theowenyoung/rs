Growth stocks and more speculative plays have been hit hard by a combination of inflationary fears and recent suggestions by monetary officials that the interest rate should be raised. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.81%, less than 1% below it’s record high. The Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a new intraday record while the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.76%. Market participants continue to monitor commentary from monetary officials, ongoing earnings season, and new economic data, particularly the April Jobs Report set for release tomorrow morning.</p>\n\n<p>After reclaiming the leadership in April as the best performing sector in the SPY, so far in May we have seen investors rotate out of big tech stocks and into financial stocks, with many big banks pushing all-time highs today. Market participants are worried that a suggested raise in interest would affect the already stretched valuation of some companies. Given the rally the market saw in April, some analysts are worried that positive catalysts for equities are getting harder to achieve and may be running out. The economy in the US is recovering faster than initially predicted by analysts, with this earnings season seeing 86% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have reported earnings  beat estimates, according to data from FactSet. </p>\n\n<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn&#39;t overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them.&quot; In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”</p>\n\n<p>The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last week—a new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. The four-week average of initial claims is also at the lowest point since the pandemic began. Read more <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-06-2021-11620247798\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be &quot;temporary.&quot; </li>\n<li>NIO announced the company will expand into Norway, with the group’s first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September.</li>\n<li>A lot of stocks pulled back despite posting better than expected earnings. The market is very narrow right now, with gains concentrated in the financials, energy, and mega-caps.</li>\n<li>IBM introduced what it says is the world&#39;s first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today&#39;s laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.
