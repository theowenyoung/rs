GME on the other hand is short 71M shares with 69M outstanding, a whopping 102%. This means GME is shorted more than its total actual shares right? Or am I doing my math wrong? I only ask because I bought $200 of AMC at close today, which I can afford to lose, but obviously no one likes to lose. </p>\n\n<p>I think GME is poised to explode more than it already has, as various predictions estimate that it’ll take 5 days for short sellers to cover their positions. I find it hard to believe that AMC has the same potential, but I’m relatively new to this so maybe there’s something I’m just not getting.
