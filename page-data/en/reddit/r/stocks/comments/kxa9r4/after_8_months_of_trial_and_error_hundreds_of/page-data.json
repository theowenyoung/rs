I was on a steady downtrend for the first 2 months (while the general market is on a steady uptrend) and found my account balance to be below $850. I had to take a break at this point and had serious thoughts about giving up. I thought I wasn&#39;t cut out to be a trader; I must be a part of the 95% who fail.  I decided to give it one more shot. I took a deep analytical dive into my past trades. I reevaluated my strategy, and found what was working and what wasn&#39;t. I slowly started seeing results. I clawed my way back to the original $1000 investment and today have officially hit the $100 profit mark. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If anyone is still reading this, I know what you&#39;re thinking: &quot;Wow, 100 bucks, big deal,&quot; and you&#39;re right. It&#39;s not much. However, If an average guy like myself can grow his account 10%, I strongly believe that anyone can; with enough dedication. I&#39;d be happy to talk more about my journey to anyone who&#39;s interested or just starting out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxa9r4/after_8_months_of_trial_and_error_hundreds_of/","title":"After 8 months of trial and error, hundreds of hours of Youtube, losing money, almost giving up, I can finally say I made my first $100 trading stocks","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-14T18:36:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-14 18:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kxa9r4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxa9r4/after_8_months_of_trial_and_error_hundreds_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxa9r4/after_8_months_of_trial_and_error_hundreds_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"sassysquatch11","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/sassysquatch11","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"sassysquatch11","score":6678,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"经过8个月的试错，在Youtube上看了几百个小时，赔了钱，差点放弃，我终于可以说我做了我的第一笔100美元的股票交易。","the_new_excerpt":"我开始进行纸质交易，并认为我所做的工作是有效的（看\n回想我的交易，让我现在感到恶心），所以我决定把1000美元在我的账户中\n并尝试它的真实。前2个月，我一直处于稳定的下跌趋势中（而\n大盘呈稳步上升趋势），发现我的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"經過8個月的試錯，在Youtube上看了幾百個小時，賠了錢，差點放棄，我終於可以說我做了我的第一筆100美元的股票交易。","the_new_excerpt":"我開始進行紙質交易，並認爲我所做的工作是有效的（看\n回想我的交易，讓我現在感到噁心），所以我決定把1000美元在我的賬戶中\n並嘗試它的真實。前2個月，我一直處於穩定的下跌趨勢中（而\n大盤呈穩步上升趨勢），發現我的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1354907029111009287","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1354907029111009287","title":"RT @elonmusk: Here come the shorty apologists\nGive them no respect\nGet Shorty","date":"January 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @elonmusk：矮子的辩护者来了。\n不尊重他们\n矮子","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"矮子的辩护人来了\n不尊重他们\n矮子"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @elonmusk：矮子的辯護者來了。\n不尊重他們\n矮子","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"矮子的辯護人來了\n不尊重他們\n矮子"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1354869149374287876","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1354869149374287876","title":"*Ring ring*\n\n\"Hello GameStop how can I help you?\"\n\n\"Yea hi I'm calling to buy 500 shares.\"","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 28, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"*戒指\n\n\"你好，游戏机公司，请问有什么可以帮你？\"\n\n\"是的，你好，我打电话买500股。\"","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"*戒指\n\n\"你好，遊戲機公司，請問有什麼可以幫你？\"\n\n\"是的，你好，我打電話買500股。\"","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-kxa9r4","previousId":"TweetPost-1354907029111009287","nextId":"TweetPost-1354869149374287876","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxa9r4/after_8_months_of_trial_and_error_hundreds_of/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
