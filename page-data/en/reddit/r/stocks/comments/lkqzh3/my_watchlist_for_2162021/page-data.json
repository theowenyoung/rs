Holding this support created by a gap well, and still basically in trend line support. RSI and Vortex are super low.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$ARDX - Super beautiful channel up right above support areas. It is trying to push high volume. Right above the 50EMA as well. Stoch and Vortex low which is great.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$CAH  - this is a strong support, no real trendline here. It did break the 200EMA so keep that in mind. All indicators are low, so will this hold? Either way, very low risk play here.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$EMP  - Great beginner play. Only 5-6% reward but very low risk as well. Great support area here. All indicators super low which is great.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$HLIT - Gorgeous channel up, but the 50EMA broke. 200 is near by, but we have a beautiful support line here too. Indicators low, so I think a reversal is near.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$MAS  - gorgeous channel right and up; it is showing higher lows. Indicators are fair, but the price action here is absolutely beautiful.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>$WYY  - Beautiful new ascending triangle forming. Right at support and trend, and again the goal is to minimize risk, which we are doing here. Indicators are low, so I think this is another great play.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lkqzh3/my_watchlist_for_2162021/","title":"My Watchlist For 2/16/2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-16T06:16:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-16 06:16","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lkqzh3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lkqzh3/my_watchlist_for_2162021/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lkqzh3/my_watchlist_for_2162021/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"No_Seesaw1134","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Seesaw1134","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"No_Seesaw1134","score":85,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我的观察清单2/16/2021","the_new_excerpt":"我使用180D/4H图进行大多数设置。我也使用RSI，随机指标，涡旋指标。\n和10-50-200EMA线.但最重要的是，价格行动是关键。\n\n\n\n我的最爱：ARDX、HLIT、MAS\n\n\n\n$AKTS--从盈利上升中下来。守住这个缺口所形成的支撑。\n好吧，而且还是基本符合潮流的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的觀察清單2/16/2021","the_new_excerpt":"我使用180D/4H圖進行大多數設置。我也使用RSI，隨機指標，渦旋指標。\n和10-50-200EMA線.但最重要的是，價格行動是關鍵。\n\n\n\n我的最愛：ARDX、HLIT、MAS\n\n\n\n$AKTS--從盈利上升中下來。守住這個缺口所形成的支撐。\n好吧，而且還是基本符合潮流的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lvp1u0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvp1u0/wsb_is_the_way_made_12m_since_joining_wsb_lost/","title":"WSB is the way.
