Valve Corp, the jury unanimously found that Valve Corp infringed Ironburg’s controller patent and awarded Corsair’s subsidiary Ironburg (a subsidiary of SCUF) over $4 million</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Own Thoughts (my own opinion and not financial advice)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>-</strong> I believe this was a blowout quarter. Taking a look at page 42 of the 8-K filing, we can see that Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 83% in 2020 year-over-year to $539 million. In Q4 2020 alone, Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $192 million. Overall revenue in 2020 grew 55% year-over-year to $1.702 billion, while in Q4 alone revenue grew by 70% year-over-year to $556 million.</p>\n\n<p>- There were expansions of gross margin in both segments (gamer and creator peripherals, and gaming components and systems). Gamer and creator peripherals gross margin has expanded to 35% from 31% in 2018, while gaming components and systems gross margin has expanded to 24% from 17% in 2018. <strong>The fact that gross margin in the components and systems segment improved by 700 bps during that time period in a market that has notoriously low margins tells me that the marketing of Corsair’s products as premium quality, is working and that customers are choosing the higher priced items over lower priced competitor items.</strong> Corsair was also able to expand margin by engaging in less promotional activities which means that consumers most definitely choosing Corsair’s higher priced products over lower-cost competitors due to a variety of reasons such as build quality and brand loyalty. </p>\n\n<p>- I was extremely impressed with the improvement of the Gamer and Creator Peripherals gross profit by 133% year-over-year, which it seems was led by their Elgato streaming products for streamers and content creators. The margins are much higher in this area than in components and streamer customers seem to regard Elgato products with high enthusiasm.</p>\n\n<p>- Adjusted EBITDA tripled in 2020 to $213 million which it seems can be attributed to an explosion of demand for Corsair’s products by customers who are spending more time at home working and gaming.</p>\n\n<p>I plan on updating this sub with all developments related to Corsair.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lg5ryq/corsair_crsr_q4_2020_earnings_results/","title":"Corsair ($CRSR) Q4 2020 Earnings Results","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T21:21:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 21:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lg5ryq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lg5ryq/corsair_crsr_q4_2020_earnings_results/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lg5ryq/corsair_crsr_q4_2020_earnings_results/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"LiveLaughLibor","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LiveLaughLibor","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"LiveLaughLibor","score":71,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"科赛尔($CRSR)2020年第四季度财报出炉","the_new_excerpt":"这是我在上周末做的Corsair DD帖子的后续文章。\n\n充分披露，我是一个股东，这不是财务建议。\n信息来自Corsair的8-K文件。这篇文章将被更新，如果有\n在稍后的财报电话会议后，是否有进一步的发展... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"科賽爾($CRSR)2020年第四季度財報出爐","the_new_excerpt":"這是我在上週末做的Corsair DD帖子的後續文章。\n\n充分披露，我是一個股東，這不是財務建議。\n信息來自Corsair的8-K文件。這篇文章將被更新，如果有\n在稍後的財報電話會議後，是否有進一步的發展... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lquj16","excerpt":"Hey guys, for my Bachelor Thesis I am working with GARCH-Models, that is a tool\nfor Time Series Analysis of a given Dataset to predict future Volatility.\n\nBeforehand, one problem with PLTR is that I don't have enough data because the\nstock is pretty new, so when I take the adjusted daily closing…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lquj16/pltr_volatility_forecast_and_price_range_wed_24/","title":"$PLTR Volatility Forecast and Price Range - Wed, 24 Feb","date":"February 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$PLTR波动率预测和价格范围 - 2月24日，星期三","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，对于我的学士论文，我正在使用GARCH-模型，这是一个工具。\n用于给定数据集的时间序列分析，以预测未来的波动率。\n\n在此之前，PLTR的一个问题是，我没有足够的数据，因为我没有足够的数据。\n股票是相当新的，所以当我把调整后的每日收盘... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$PLTR波動率預測和價格範圍 - 2月24日，星期三","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，對於我的學士論文，我正在使用GARCH-模型，這是一個工具。\n用於給定數據集的時間序列分析，以預測未來的波動率。\n\n在此之前，PLTR的一個問題是，我沒有足夠的數據，因爲我沒有足夠的數據。\n股票是相當新的，所以當我把調整後的每日收盤... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lqoilz","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqoilz/attack_on_titans/","title":"Attack on Titans","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 24, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"攻击泰坦","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"攻擊泰坦","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lg5ryq","previousId":"RedditPost-lquj16","nextId":"RedditPost-lqoilz","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lg5ryq/corsair_crsr_q4_2020_earnings_results/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
