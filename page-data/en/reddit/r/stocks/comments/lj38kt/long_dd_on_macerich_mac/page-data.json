So let&#39;s go through them one by one and see how bad they are.</p>\n\n<h2>Their debt</h2>\n\n<p>They&#39;ve increased their debt (from 54.5% in 2018 to 66.4% in 2019 to a whopping 83.5% of their market cap in end 2020). Leverage like that on shopping centers (you know that thing you don&#39;t go to anymore because of amazon and the pandemic) could be ok : they don&#39;t really care about the declining revenue of those shopping centers, they just need them to pay their leases. But 2 things are pretty worrisome : i) some retail stores might go bankrupt and ii) Macerich is using $1.5bn of their line of credit.</p>\n\n<p>To counteract that : The bankruptcy issue for retail stores is not that big of a deal for Macerich  and they have a (good) plan if they have to repurpose a shopping mall (both explained below). And for the line of credit thingy, their unencumbered assets (an asset or property that is free and clear of any encumbrances, such as creditor claims or liens) are sufficient enough to cover their $1.5bn in line of credit if it&#39;s needed. They can also dilute the shares to raise more capital. They&#39;ve also filed for an ATM offering for up to $500 million.</p>\n\n<h2>Occupancy / Rent collection</h2>\n\n<p>Their occupancy is at 89.7  % (for the shopping centers that are not under development nor redevelopment). This is down from the 95.4% it was at in 2018 or the 94% in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The good news however is that &quot;<em>rent collections, for example, during April and May were 35%, that grew to 80% in the third quarter. And as of today, the fourth quarter rent collections were at 92% and rising by the week.</em>&quot; said Tom O&#39;Hern, CEO of Macerich in their recent Earnings call.</p>\n\n<h2>The declining trend of brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls in general</h2>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a big one and this has been a much bigger trend as the pandemic forced some people to buy things online. This trend is also not new at all as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/21561046/death-rebirth-department-stores-retail-charts\">this Vox article shows very well</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But the silver lining is that as some retail stores are going bankrupt, the big shopping centers are getting stronger from having less competition. And since Macerich has mostly big shopping centers, that&#39;s pretty good for them.</p>\n\n<h2>What about the bankrupt stores in the near future</h2>\n\n<p>Green Street Advisors expects &quot;about a little more than half of all mall-based department stores to close by the end of 2021.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That can be a big problem but  they seem to be prepared for it. They&#39;re planning on doing some mixed-use development and I like it. Doug said in their most recent earnings call :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, we know our shoppers want more than just traditional retail. And that&#39;s why we continue to focus on bringing alternative uses to our campuses and not just retail. Uses like office, residential, hospitality, medical, wellness, education, fitness, grocery, service and even storage, and that&#39;s why we continue to refer to our properties as town centers because that&#39;s what they&#39;re becoming. They&#39;re transformational and will be something for everyone. And they have to be because that&#39;s what our modern-day shopper wants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What makes me even more optimistic is that most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). Those are very high density locations which are the most promising places for redevelopment or for mixed-use purposes.</p>\n\n<h2>The repurpose of their buildings</h2>\n\n<p>That&#39;s great to know that they&#39;re <em>planning</em> on &quot;bringing alternative uses to [their] campuses&quot; but how faisible is it and how much will that help them?</p>\n\n<p>First, let&#39;s see what Macerich could convert its buildings to :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Offices but there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty in this area. We&#39;re in the middle of a big shift in this regard which might benefit them or not.</li>\n<li>Other retail stores but jesus christ this market is not doing good right now and has not been doing well years before the pandemic.</li>\n<li>Industrial complexes like warehouses are booming right now thanks to e-commerce and the pandemic. This looks really promising if they go down that road but they need to do this quickly and strategically as all locations are not necessarily interesting. </li>\n<li>Housing which a lot of real estate have mixed feelings about.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or Macerich could do another interesting thing : mixed-use development. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is a type of urban development, urban planning and/or a zoning type that blends residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or entertainment uses into one space, where those functions are to some degree physically and functionally integrated, and that provides pedestrian connections.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). So let&#39;s evaluate their possibilities in those locations that they&#39;ve invested in. </p>\n\n<p><strong>California</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start with California and use <a href=\"https://www.allenmatkins.com/anderson-forecast/allen-matkins-ucla-anderson-forecast-california-cre-survey.html\">the Allen Matkins/UCLA Anderson 2021 winter forecast</a>. They&#39;ve polled a lot of real estate professionals in California and here are the results :</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re pretty pessimistic about offices ROI today but they&#39;re confident that demand will increase. HOWEVER, &quot;<em>the panelists believe that newly built space, in addition to that freed by companies reducing their existing space, will outstrip any near-term increased demand for office space</em>&quot;. Outch! Right in the feels!</p>\n\n<p>Ok so not offices how about retail spaces? That one is short : &quot;<em>62% of panelists indicated that they will not develop any new properties in the coming 12 months</em>&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Also :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Overall, the level of new retail property construction is expected to significantly decline from 2020 through 2023; and some existing space, lacking sufficient demand, will be converted to other uses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, for the industrial space market, they&#39;re really optimistic : &quot;<em>approximately 30 percent of the panelists stated that the experience of the recession has caused them to consider increasing the amount of development they will undertake.</em>&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re also expecting that the housing market will grow steadily when the economy rebounds.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m pretty optimistic for California if they need to repurpose their buildings : they could turn those spaces into housing or warehouses/industrial complexes or in mixed-use schemes.</p>\n\n<p>And how about Ney York??</p>\n\n<p><strong>New York</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well... The short-term outlook is not that pretty!</p>\n\n<p>In end of July 2020, Metro Manhattan reports that <a href=\"https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-new-york-city-office-sales-drop-58-during-lockdown/\">Office sales have dropped 58%</a> and <a href=\"https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-retail-sales-activity-drops-78-during-nyc-lockdown/\">retail sales activity dropped 78%</a> during the lockdown.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/2020/10/19/new-yorks-cre-woes-could-spread-nationwide-investors/\">Also</a> :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Citing Trepp, the Journal reported that more than $3 billion worth of loans backing commercial property in the five boroughs are delinquent, and loans in creditor negotiations amount to an additional $4 billion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, a lot of people are leaving the city because i) it&#39;s the epicenter of the pandemic and ii) it&#39;s a very dense city that was attractive because most of the activity is there. Now that people can work from home, they&#39;re no longer trapped in the city and <a href=\"https://www.mymove.com/moving/covid-19/coronavirus-moving-trends/\">110,00 people left during the lockdown as a result</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So all of this hurts offices, housing market and retail stores (because less people means less sales) <em>in the short term</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For the long term, long story short, that&#39;s going to be the same as California but they will need to repurpose a lot more buildings as the situation is much worse in New York.</p>\n\n<p><strong>An the rest of the commercial real estate though?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/commercial-real-estate-outlook.html\">a nice report</a> by Deloitte. The key messages summarize it well but I encourage you to read the whole thing as this is pretty interesting not only for Macerich but for all REIT investing in shopping centers in the US.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Macerich is pretty undervalued right now with a maket cap close to $2bn. It&#39;s pretty understandable because of the situation it is in right now : their debt is pretty important and commercial real estate is in terrible state right now in general. But their finances getting better as of end 2020, their occupancy approaching 90%, their interesting plans for unoccupied stores and the promising long-term outlook in California and New York (the 2 locations they&#39;re mostly invested in) shows a very good upside while the downside seems to be already priced in.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lj38kt/long_dd_on_macerich_mac/","title":"Long DD on Macerich ($MAC)","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T13:25:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 13:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lj38kt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lj38kt/long_dd_on_macerich_mac/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lj38kt/long_dd_on_macerich_mac/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ThisIsBartRick","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThisIsBartRick","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ThisIsBartRick","score":46,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"马切里奇($MAC)的长线DD","the_new_excerpt":"导言\n\nMacerich是一家专门从事购物中心的房地产投资信托基金（你知道的，就是那个东西）。\n因为亚马逊和疫情，你不再去的地方）。)\n\n公司方面表现非常糟糕（入住率从2018年的95.4%降至89.8%。\n2020年从2018年的95.4%）和股价（它从...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"馬切裏奇($MAC)的長線DD","the_new_excerpt":"導言\n\nMacerich是一家專門從事購物中心的房地產投資信託基金（你知道的，就是那個東西）。\n因爲亞馬遜和疫情，你不再去的地方）。)\n\n公司方面表現非常糟糕（入住率從2018年的95.4%降至89.8%。\n2020年從2018年的95.4%）和股價（它從...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1366114960124837898","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1366114960124837898","title":"Asset Class Returns over the Last 10 Years...\n\nData via @ycharts https://t.co/EJZ5QVVs99","date":"February 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"过去10年的资产类别回报率......\n\n数据来源于 @ycharts https://t.co/EJZ5QVVs99","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"過去10年的資產類別回報率......\n\n數據來源於 @ycharts https://t.co/EJZ5QVVs99","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-luaheg","excerpt":"PLUG had an incredible run up in the last few months up to 73$.
