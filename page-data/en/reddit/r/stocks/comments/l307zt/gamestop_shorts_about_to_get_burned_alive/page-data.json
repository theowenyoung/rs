But if you fully understand how that strategy works then you also fully understand that 98% of all of the GameStop short sellers are about to get the life burned out of them. The only way this stock can continue going up is if other short sellers continue having bad positions and end up losing money. For 98% of you short sellers you&#39;re in it way too early. You going to end up buying those shares at much higher prices and in the process burning out other short sellers. That however is going to continue to push the price upward. Only the short sellers in the very end will win. And take this from a former GameStop employee. A lot of the upper management team of GameStop hold a dick load of shares. When they finally drop out so that they can cap these gains. The only people who are going to make money are them and the short sellers who would be holding positions when that happens.
