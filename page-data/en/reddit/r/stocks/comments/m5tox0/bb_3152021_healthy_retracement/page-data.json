If you missed it, here&#39;s the link on <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/</a>  </p>\n\n<p>This is a healthy retracement, we were not respecting the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour and hourly chart, and were in the overbought territory on the RSI. Everything else is falling into place, we are looking good.  </p>\n\n<p>Although I myself was excited to see $BB in the $12 range premarket and in the morning, I myself was wondering if we were about to see a blow-off, it looks like AMC ruled the day today.    </p>\n\n<p>Average volume daily today too which is nice to see, probably some profit-taking as we are up 40% from the bottom at 8.83 which is fine by me. People can take their pennies if they wish, I&#39;m more into the long game and swing trading ain&#39;t really my jam.</p>\n\n<p>Continue accumulating and holding, we are looking extremely strong and this pullback was very very healthy.   </p>\n\n<p>From all aspects of technical analysis standpoint, this is an absolute screaming buy.<br/>\nFrom a fundamentalist&#39;s view, those who know the sentiment, the deals, the products, and the history, this is a screaming buy.<br/>\nFrom a speculatory view or the ultra-long like 2-3 years down the road, this is a screaming buy.  </p>\n\n<p>Think of this stock as smoking a brisket or making a nice prime rib roast. We want this baby to cook low and slow, or in another way set it and forget. If you do that you&#39;ll get the tastiest, juiciest reward.   </p>\n\n<p>Take care.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m5tox0/bb_3152021_healthy_retracement/","title":"$BB 3/15/2021 - Healthy Retracement","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-15T23:51:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-15 23:51","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m5tox0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m5tox0/bb_3152021_healthy_retracement/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m5tox0/bb_3152021_healthy_retracement/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Virtual-Pin1025","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Virtual-Pin1025","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Virtual-Pin1025","score":148,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$BB 3/15/2021----健康矫正术","the_new_excerpt":"大家好!\n\n这是我上一篇文章的交集。如果你错过了它，这里是链接在\nr/stocks [/r/stocks]\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/\n\n这是一个健康的回调，我们在布林线上没有尊重。\n4…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$BB 3/15/2021----健康矯正術","the_new_excerpt":"大家好!\n\n這是我上一篇文章的交集。如果你錯過了它，這裏是鏈接在\nr/stocks [/r/stocks]\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/\n\n這是一個健康的回調，我們在布林線上沒有尊重。\n4…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mkixis","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkixis/gme_daytrading_simulation/","title":"GME Daytrading Simulation","date":"April 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME日间交易模拟","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME日間交易模擬","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"},{"title":"GME デイトレード・シミュレーション","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja-JA"},{"title":"GME デイトレード・シミュレーション","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mkk8ws","excerpt":"A couple of really good reads from Yahoo Finance for people that are staying out\nof the market because of the high valuations.\n\nValuations don't actually appear to be mean-reverting.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-valuations-not-mean-reverting-morning-brief-110134302.html\n\n\n\nStock…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mkk8ws/if_elevated_valuations_kept_you_out_of_the_market/","title":"If elevated valuations kept you out of the market, you might've missed out on some of the greatest market returns in history.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果抬高的估值让你远离市场，你可能已经错过了一些历史上最伟大的市场回报。","the_new_excerpt":"雅虎财经的几篇真正好读的文章，适合置身事外的人。\n的市场，因为高估值。\n\n估值其实并没有出现均值回归。\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-valuations-not-mean-reverting-morning-brief-110134302.html\n\n\n\n股票...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果擡高的估值讓你遠離市場，你可能已經錯過了一些歷史上最偉大的市場回報。","the_new_excerpt":"雅虎財經的幾篇真正好讀的文章，適合置身事外的人。\n的市場，因爲高估值。\n\n估值其實並沒有出現均值迴歸。\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-valuations-not-mean-reverting-morning-brief-110134302.html\n\n\n\n股票...","locale":"zh-Hant"},{"title":"バリュエーションの上昇によって市場に参加しなかったとしたら、史上最大の市場リターンのいくつかを逃していたかもしれません。","the_new_excerpt":"市場から離れている人のために、Yahoo Financeが提供するいくつかの優れた記事を紹介します。\n高いバリュエーションのために市場から離れている人のためのYahoo Financeの記事です。\n\nバリュエーションは実際には平均回帰していないようです。\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-valuations-not-mean-reverting-morning-brief-110134302.html\n\n\n\n株式...","locale":"ja-JA"},{"title":"バリュエーションの上昇によって市場に参加しなかったとしたら、史上最大の市場リターンのいくつかを逃していたかもしれません。","the_new_excerpt":"市場から離れている人のために、Yahoo Financeが提供するいくつかの優れた記事を紹介します。\n高いバリュエーションのために市場から離れている人のためのYahoo Financeの記事です。\n\nバリュエーションは実際には平均回帰していないようです。\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-valuations-not-mean-reverting-morning-brief-110134302.html\n\n\n\n株式...","locale":"ja"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m5tox0","previousId":"RedditPost-mkixis","nextId":"RedditPost-mkk8ws","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m5tox0/bb_3152021_healthy_retracement/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
