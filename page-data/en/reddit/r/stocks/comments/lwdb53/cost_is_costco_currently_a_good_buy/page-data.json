Currently have been looking at stocks that I feel are currently undervalued that have great products/services that I am a fan of. Costco fits this description as I shop their frequently, love their free food samples, love that they pay their employees very well, love the membership money format Costco has set up, love the cheap hot dogs and $5 chickens you can buy. I haven’t seen anything scandalous like sexual assault allegations on the CEO or full closures of every location like other business due to the pandemic, yet their stock since around December of 2020 has been falling closer and closer to their March 2020 pandemic low. (I’ve been using the pandemic low number of each stock I evaluate as their true value indicator) Was curious with the stock being 52 week low of around $280 and 52 week high of $380 if $COST currently sits near $330 is this the time to jump in? Is there some metric or type of graph analysis that I can use to try and more accurately predict the “bottom value” before their stock begins climbing again?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lwdb53/cost_is_costco_currently_a_good_buy/","title":"$COST .... is Costco currently a good buy?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-03T16:27:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-03 16:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lwdb53","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lwdb53/cost_is_costco_currently_a_good_buy/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lwdb53/cost_is_costco_currently_a_good_buy/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"CLYDEFR000G","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/CLYDEFR000G","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"CLYDEFR000G","score":40,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$COST ....
