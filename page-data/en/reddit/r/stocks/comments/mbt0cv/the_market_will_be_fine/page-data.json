This explains why the Yields actually went down a lot while the rest of the market as a whole was tanking.</p>\n\n<p>But if you noticed, one thing did well: FAANG. Why? because analysts expect the yields going down to help the large cap growth stocks.</p>\n\n<p>But i think once the large funds are done rebalancing, people will buy back into the market for sure with the low yields, and we should see growth doing better.</p>\n\n<p>I think the most important thing is to not panic and hold to our red positions... If the feds was able to save us from a massive covid crash, they can save us from a tiny dip that was caused by literally nothing lol</p>\n\n<p>Note: I expect April could still be volatile, but i really think the summer will good to us, and Q4 even better =)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mbt0cv/the_market_will_be_fine/","title":"The market will be fine","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-24T03:02:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-24 03:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mbt0cv","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mbt0cv/the_market_will_be_fine/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mbt0cv/the_market_will_be_fine/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Floofyboy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Floofyboy","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Floofyboy","score":258,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"市场会好起来的","the_new_excerpt":"今天让很多人着急了，因为今天的天气相当的差，因为没有。\n显而易见的原因。这里是我找到的最好的解释。\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/pension-funds-have-to-buy-bonds-to-rebalance-portfolios-and-that-might-be-good-for-stocks.html\n\n总之，它看起来像很多大...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"市場會好起來的","the_new_excerpt":"今天讓很多人着急了，因爲今天的天氣相當的差，因爲沒有。\n顯而易見的原因。這裏是我找到的最好的解釋。\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/pension-funds-have-to-buy-bonds-to-rebalance-portfolios-and-that-might-be-good-for-stocks.html\n\n總之，它看起來像很多大...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-msqj5s","excerpt":"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks [/r/stocks].
