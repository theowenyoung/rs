This is good. Drastically over solid on Thursday and saw a retest of $10 USD but got rejected. As of writing this, I would have to say ~$9.00USD is the bottom and pending reversal. Using a line starting from October 30th that touches Jan 5th, March 5th and today we dipped under the trend line, recovered, and then dipped under it again. I hope this doesn&#39;t act as resistance otherwise I&#39;m not sure how far down we&#39;ll sink. Financials come out after hours on March 30th, so we could slide a bit more until then.  </p>\n\n<p>THINGS TO LOOK FOR ON FINANCIALS:<br/>\n-Sale of patents to Huwaeii<br/>\n-Facebook Settlement<br/>\n-EBIDTA Positive<br/>\n-Revenue<br/>\n-Debt<br/>\nAll the obvious shit. I shouldn&#39;t need to remind you dinguses but with all these things in mind, this could be a very strong earnings play for those that are not in or are looking to get in. I can with strong confidence currently say all of these things will be higher than expected.   </p>\n\n<p>WELL, WHY THE FUCK DO YOU SAY THAT?:<br/>\nBecause I have my opinions and opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.<br/>\nBut also:<br/>\n-Massive recent hiring postings on at BB for<br/>\n<a href=\"https://bb.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/BlackBerry/3/refreshFacet/318c8bb6f553100021d223d9780d30be\">https://bb.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/BlackBerry/3/refreshFacet/318c8bb6f553100021d223d9780d30be</a><br/>\nAlso, you can check LinkedIn for other more recent postings.<br/>\nMeans they have the cash to burn and ready to lock and load and put their software to work<br/>\n-BB IVY Innovation Fund<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy/innovation-fund\">https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy/innovation-fund</a><br/>\nThis means they&#39;re willing to front/invest their own cash and prove their product works and is worthy of investment. Spend a little bit now, retrieve it later in subscription-based licensing and also purchase of applications, like an &quot;app store&quot; but for cars. One application that comes to mind immediately is hours-of-service apps for commercial truck drivers, but that&#39;s one main of several I have.</p>\n\n<p>Lets now look at the chart:<br/>\n1 Hour:<br/>\nRSI - Massively oversold on Thursday, no surprise we had a dead cat bounce. I am also curious as to why everything rallied in the last 90 minutes across the market, not sure what to think here<br/>\n-Bollinger bands - Tight af. Looking for breakout after that downtrend<br/>\n-50 DMA - I&#39;m sad we didn&#39;t hold above the 50 DMA but it&#39;s fine, it tried but ultimately lost. A expect a retest soon after financials.<br/>\n-Trendline - as I stated above, closed Friday using the major trendline from October 30th as resistance. I&#39;m not too concerned about it because of financials but we shall see what the financials bring  </p>\n\n<p>4 hour:<br/>\nRSI - Almost oversold, on the low end. Lots of room to move up<br/>\nBollinger bands - Thursday we oversold and did not respect the bands and got a bounce, otherwise again our dead cat bounce. I like this because this broke the falling knife.   </p>\n\n<p>Daily:<br/>\nRSI - Healthy, below center. Has the room to move up or down.<br/>\n20 DMA and 50 DMA are completely in line with each other currently and have been since March 12th. I&#39;m interested to see how this plays out. We&#39;re trading below both right now so eventually, this has to break.<br/>\nBollinger Bands - Tightened up as best as it can prior to financials, expecting a breakout from the bottom. </p>\n\n<p>Not much else to report. Financials should be sexy. DYOD you idiots and do not take this as financial advice because last week I shit my pants playing Fortnite.</p>\n\n<p>Take care</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mei0eo/bb_3262021_technical_analysis_and_earnings/","title":"$BB 3/26/2021 - Technical Analysis and Earnings","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-28T01:13:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-28 01:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mei0eo","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mei0eo/bb_3262021_technical_analysis_and_earnings/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mei0eo/bb_3262021_technical_analysis_and_earnings/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Virtual-Pin1025","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Virtual-Pin1025","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Virtual-Pin1025","score":88,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"$BB 3/26/2021 - 技术分析和盈利情况。","the_new_excerpt":"你们好，这是我再次得到我每周固定的确认偏见。\n\n什么他妈的发生了本周在图表上。\n仍然确认被断开 从WSB ... 暂时。这是好的。\n周四大幅过稳，看到10美元的重测，但被拒绝了。\n在写这篇文章的时候, 我已经...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$BB 3/26/2021 - 技術分析和盈利情況。","the_new_excerpt":"你們好，這是我再次得到我每週固定的確認偏見。\n\n什麼他媽的發生了本週在圖表上。\n仍然確認被斷開 從WSB ... 暫時。這是好的。\n週四大幅過穩，看到10美元的重測，但被拒絕了。\n在寫這篇文章的時候, 我已經...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mxg5r4","excerpt":"Hey all!
