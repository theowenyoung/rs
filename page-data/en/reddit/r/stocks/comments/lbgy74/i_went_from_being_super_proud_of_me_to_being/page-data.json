I lost money to AMC, GME. Not anywhere near people I see in WSB, but right now, I am down $1500. I know this is loose change for a lot of you and honestly, it&#39;s not an amount that&#39;s going to put me on the street or anything,  but it was my summer earnings that I saved for a trip to New York and cities around (I am from Canada). </p>\n\n<p>I am a business student, currently in University and investment finance always seemed very interesting and fascinating to me. So, since Canada banned non-essential travels between US/Canada borders, I was left with vacation money which was around 3000 USD. </p>\n\n<p>Instead of putting it in a savings account, I decided to finally start investing. I was using subs like <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a>, <a href=\"/r/personalfinance\">r/personalfinance</a>, <a href=\"/r/personalfinancecanada\">r/personalfinancecanada</a> for forums and was doing my own market research (the best somebody can do with little knowledge), learning, and was super excited to finally find a sector I wanted to invest in. Renewable Energy. I invested all of my $3000 in $PLUG, $FCELL and the rest in companies that are safe like $AAPL, $CIBC. It was fantastic. In just around 2 months, I made over 40% on my 3000$ capital and I was really proud of myself. I was motivated to do more research, learn more, and I felt good about myself (University grades were great, potential internships coming soon hopefully), it was just perfect. </p>\n\n<p>And then the GME, AMC thing started. So much contents, memes, to the moon post, that at one point, I completely lost my common sense, my rational part of the brain stopped working, I went from speaking like a normal person to... You know what I am talking about. My emoji recommendation changed to the rocket, diamonds, it&#39;s like I completely lost myself into a wild cocaine party full of booze and tequila marijuana smoothie with mushroom garnitures and I drank them all and decided to become a R... (As they say).</p>\n\n<p>My senses came back today morning once I finally noticed what I had actually done, and realized how much I went against all the single concepts and fundamentals I used to start trading. </p>\n\n<p>I am still holding, because well, market&#39;s closed but I seriously don&#39;t know what to do. Good companies go back up. Gamestop has nothing backing itself up except rumours of a potential short saueeze and faith of millions who went all in. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not the $3000 (net) that&#39;s bothering me, it&#39;s just that, I started out like a normal person who was doing amazing and got turned into a cult member. I am not hating into anybody of WSB, I don&#39;t even blame them. I blame my own judgement. I learnt my lesson but then again, it&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t know what I was getting into. It was mostly stupidity and greed I think. </p>\n\n<p>Any advice, any suggestion, any smack in the head, reality check would be appreciated. Sorry for the rant. This is the only sane community that deals with stocks currently.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lbgy74/i_went_from_being_super_proud_of_me_to_being/","title":"I went from being super proud of me to being disgusted of myself in just 2 months","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T09:28:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 09:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lbgy74","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbgy74/i_went_from_being_super_proud_of_me_to_being/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbgy74/i_went_from_being_super_proud_of_me_to_being/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Pri47","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pri47","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Pri47","score":768,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我从超级骄傲到厌恶自己，只用了两个月时间","the_new_excerpt":"看标题就知道这是怎么回事了。我赔钱给AMC、GME。\n比我在WSB看到的人差远了，但现在，我下降了1500美元。我知道，我知道\n这对你们很多人来说都是零钱，说实话，这不是一个金额，是\n要把我在街上或任何东西， 但它是我的夏天... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我從超級驕傲到厭惡自己，只用了兩個月時間","the_new_excerpt":"看標題就知道這是怎麼回事了。我賠錢給AMC、GME。\n比我在WSB看到的人差遠了，但現在，我下降了1500美元。我知道，我知道\n這對你們很多人來說都是零錢，說實話，這不是一個金額，是\n要把我在街上或任何東西， 但它是我的夏天... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ljouz3","excerpt":"I've got some long and short term purchases of a mutual fund, FSKAX.
