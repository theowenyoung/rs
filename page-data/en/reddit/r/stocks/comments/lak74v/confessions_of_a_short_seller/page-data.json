Margin calls out the ass. Like $200k per day. If I bought back the stock (covered) I would never be able to borrow it again so I would be totally locked out. I bought the same number of shares that I was short so that I was both short and long (short against the box it is called). No matter which way the stock went I was even. When it finally peaked at $55 and started falling like a rock I sold my long side every day that I had enough margin and rode it down to $9. I made about $180k but believe me, it wasn&#39;t worth the stress.</p>\n\n<p>I am so tired of people saying that the shorts haven&#39;t covered. Or one neophyte asking &quot;What day are the shorts going to cover?&quot; I don&#39;t have a horse in this race (I day traded it last week several times) but I feel very bad for the new people getting in at the high. Especially one who said &quot;I paid my rent by credit card and used the money to buy GME&quot; That person is already under water.</p>\n\n<p>GME shorts all covered and/or boxed last week. Do you really think that you guys collectively have enough buying power to move it it from $65 to $483 with 500 million shares on your own? Time for a reality check.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/","title":"Confessions of a short seller","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T03:37:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 03:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lak74v","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"bighdaddie","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bighdaddie","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bighdaddie","score":29,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"卖空者的自白","the_new_excerpt":"你想要现实吗？我在80年代是个大空头。做空Iomega\n12元，就到了55元。保证金叫出了屁股。比如每天20万。如果我\n买回股票（覆盖），我将永远无法再借到它，所以我\n会被完全锁定。我买了同样数量的股票... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"賣空者的自白","the_new_excerpt":"你想要現實嗎？我在80年代是個大空頭。做空Iomega\n12元，就到了55元。保證金叫出了屁股。比如每天20萬。如果我\n買回股票（覆蓋），我將永遠無法再借到它，所以我\n會被完全鎖定。我買了同樣數量的股票... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lig9vn","excerpt":"International brokers sued over naked short selling allegations CIBC, Bank of\nAmerica, UBS and TD Bank stand accused of coordinating “abusive” naked short\nselling and spoofing strategies in US and Canadian stock markets by a Bermuda\nhedge fund that claims to have lost tens of millions of dollars as…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lig9vn/cibc_bank_of_america_ubs_and_td_bank_stand/","title":"CIBC, Bank of America, UBS and TD Bank stand accused of coordinating “abusive” naked short selling and spoofing strategies","date":"February 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"CIBC、美国银行、瑞银和道明银行被指控协调 \"滥用 \"裸卖空和恶搞策略。","the_new_excerpt":"国际经纪商因裸卖空指控被起诉 CIBC、银行\n美团、瑞银和道明银行被指协调 \"滥竽充数 \"裸短\n百慕大人在美国和加拿大股票市场的卖出和欺骗策略\n对冲基金，声称已经损失了数千万美元，因为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CIBC、美國銀行、瑞銀和道明銀行被指控協調 \"濫用 \"裸賣空和惡搞策略。","the_new_excerpt":"國際經紀商因裸賣空指控被起訴 CIBC、銀行\n美團、瑞銀和道明銀行被指協調 \"濫竽充數 \"裸短\n百慕大人在美國和加拿大股票市場的賣出和欺騙策略\n對沖基金，聲稱已經損失了數千萬美元，因爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-li2yau","excerpt":"So overall, I'm quite bullish on this ticker, yet its probably one of the worst\nperforming stocks in my portfolio, down 29% since it came onto the market on Jan\n22, 2021.\n\nI've combed through their financials and they look solid. 1.2 billion in cash,\nEPS profitability, a declared dividend of .10c /…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/li2yau/uwmc_seems_extremely_undervalued_to_me/","title":"$UWMC seems extremely undervalued to me","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 12, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"在我看来，UWMC的价值被严重低估了。","the_new_excerpt":"所以总体来说，我很看好这个行情，但其可能是最差的一个行情。\n在我的投资组合中，自1月1日上市以来下跌了29%。\n22, 2021.\n\n我梳理了一下他们的财务数据，他们看起来很稳健。12亿现金。\nEPS盈利能力，宣布分红0.10c/...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在我看來，UWMC的價值被嚴重低估了。","the_new_excerpt":"所以總體來說，我很看好這個行情，但其可能是最差的一個行情。\n在我的投資組合中，自1月1日上市以來下跌了29%。\n22, 2021.\n\n我梳理了一下他們的財務數據，他們看起來很穩健。12億現金。\nEPS盈利能力，宣佈分紅0.10c/...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lak74v","previousId":"RedditPost-lig9vn","nextId":"RedditPost-li2yau","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
