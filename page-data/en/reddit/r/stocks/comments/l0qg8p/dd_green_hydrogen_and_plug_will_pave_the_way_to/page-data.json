Biden Jr. is a believe in clean energy &amp; more specifically hydrogen. When he reveals his Build Back Better Plan in February you can darn well expect another bump in Plug Power. (Reminder Chuck Schumer, D-NY senator is close with Andy Marsh the CEO of Plug Power, is a believer in Hydrogen, and will make sure that Plug Power&#39;s mission gets pushed through legislation in any future clean energy plans)</p>\n\n<p>Here is Biden&#39;s stance on clean energy <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/\">https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/</a> .
