I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago <strong>(credit:</strong> <a href=\"/u/bEAc0n\">u/bEAc0n</a>) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.</p>\n\n<p>This website is run by a <strong>dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income</strong> and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.</p>\n\n<p>I sent him an email and this was his response</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thanks for the kind words.  </p>\n\n<p>No problem with your request.

Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. <strong>At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m14jye/a_10_part_series_that_will_clearly_explain_what/","title":"A 10 part series that will clearly explain what is going on with Naked Shorting in Stock Market","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-09T15:41:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-09 15:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m14jye","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m14jye/a_10_part_series_that_will_clearly_explain_what/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m14jye/a_10_part_series_that_will_clearly_explain_what/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Tepllhcgftwhdg","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tepllhcgftwhdg","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Tepllhcgftwhdg","score":5092,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"一个10部分的系列，将清楚地解释什么是赤裸裸地在股市做空","the_new_excerpt":"把你的锡箔纸帽子拿出来，它的时间来看看你认为你想看到的，但。\n不真的想。这对于任何一个新手来说都是完美的，他们想了解什么是\n是怎么回事，以及如何系统已经结束的方式。\n\nTl;Dr在最后。\n\n有很多伟大的DD，清楚地解释了裸空的3... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個10部分的系列，將清楚地解釋什麼是赤裸裸地在股市做空","the_new_excerpt":"把你的錫箔紙帽子拿出來，它的時間來看看你認爲你想看到的，但。\n不真的想。這對於任何一個新手來說都是完美的，他們想了解什麼是\n是怎麼回事，以及如何系統已經結束的方式。\n\nTl;Dr在最後。\n\n有很多偉大的DD，清楚地解釋了裸空的3... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mcxiyn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcxiyn/still_holding_polish_diamond_hands_confirmed/","title":"Still holding - Polish diamond hands confirmed 💎🙌🚀🇵🇱","date":"March 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"还在坚持 - 波兰钻石手确认💎🙌🚀🇵🇱","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"還在堅持 - 波蘭鑽石手確認💎🙌🚀🇵🇱","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mcyl1b","excerpt":"> New jobless claims fell to the lowest levels of the pandemic era, federal data\n> shows, with 684,000 being filed last week.\n> \n> The previous weekly high was 695,000, set in October 1982.\n> \n> Initial unemployment claims fell by 97,000, another sign that the economic\n> impact of the coronavirus\n>…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mcyl1b/jobless_claims_fall_to_lowest_level_of_the/","title":"Jobless claims fall to lowest level of the pandemic","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 25, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"失业金申领人数降至疫情最低水平","the_new_excerpt":"> 联邦数据显示，新申请失业救济金人数降至大流行时代的最低水平。\n> 显示，上周申请量为68.4万。\n> \n> 之前的周度高点是1982年10月创下的695,000点。\n> \n> 初请失业金人数下降9.7万，这是另一个迹象，表明经济的\n> 冠状病毒的影响\n>…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"失業金申領人數降至疫情最低水平","the_new_excerpt":"> 聯邦數據顯示，新申請失業救濟金人數降至大流行時代的最低水平。\n> 顯示，上週申請量爲68.4萬。\n> \n> 之前的周度高點是1982年10月創下的695,000點。\n> \n> 初請失業金人數下降9.7萬，這是另一個跡象，表明經濟的\n> 冠狀病毒的影響\n>…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m14jye","previousId":"RedditPost-mcxiyn","nextId":"RedditPost-mcyl1b","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m14jye/a_10_part_series_that_will_clearly_explain_what/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
