After hitting a 14-month high of 1.75%, the Treasury yield retreated to 1.616% at the time of writing. Many of the cyclical stocks that had led markets higher for much of the last three months underperformed, and the industrials, energy, and financials sectors lagged.</p>\n\n<p>Market participants have also digested recent remarks from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.” While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market continues to react sharply to these statements, even though they have largely been the same for months. </p>\n\n<p>After a slow start last year, the US’ vaccination efforts are starting to paint an increasingly encouraging picture, with roughly 70% of Americans 65 years and older receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, and coronavirus related deaths have dropped below 1,000 a day on average for the first time since early November, according to data compiled by the Associated Press. Also, dozens of states have thrown open vaccinations to all adults or are planning to do so in a matter of weeks. And the White House said 27 million doses of both the one-shot and two-shot vaccines will be distributed next week, more than three times the number when President Joe Biden took office two months ago, again according to the Associated Press. </p>\n\n<p>The rosy outlook in the US remains in stark crisis to the unfolding crisis in Europe, with many officials warning or talking about a “third-wave of the virus”. Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measures for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and a reduction in the availability of intensive-care units (ICUs). UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to &quot;wash up on our shores.&quot; Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine (<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84\">Report by the Associated Press</a>). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>After years of false starts, New York state lawmakers said Wednesday that they had reached an agreement to legalize the sale of marijuana for recreational use by adults starting next year.
