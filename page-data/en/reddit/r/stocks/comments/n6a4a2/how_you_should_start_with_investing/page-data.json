As such I figured I&#39;d just make a quick post to recommend what I feel is the best way to get started in the stock market.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Take 90% of your capital that you would like to invest and put it in a total market index fund like VTI or FZROX</strong></p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re new at this, no matter how much research you have done you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing and will make mistakes. Putting your money into an index fund will give you good returns along with the security of knowing with 99.999% certainty that if there is a dip it WILL recover (and if it doesn&#39;t you probably have bigger problems to worry about). It will also help you get used to the ups and downs of the market without getting emotional.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Start paper trading</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most brokerages offer a &quot;paper trading&quot; account. These are accounts where you invest with fake money and can track how you would have done with these investments. I know you&#39;re excited and want to start investing now so you can make money, but you&#39;re new and will likely fall into one of several common pitfalls of new investors, better to do this with fake money than real money. And besides if you follow step 1 your money <em>is</em> invested and you are getting good returns.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3*: Start using your 10% cash to make real stock purchases</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once you do well after a few months to a year of paper trading (it seems like a long time I know but trust me the stock market will still be there when you&#39;re done), take some of your remaining capital and start buying stocks. Real investing is not like paper trading when it comes to your actual money, keep that in mind. You will find yourself panicking for the first time here, that&#39;s fine, remember the vast majority of your money is in a solid investment with little risk and good returns.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4*: Start moving more into stock picks</strong></p>\n\n<p>After a few years of doing well with your 10%, if you feel like you&#39;d rather pick your own stocks over using an index fund then start moving money out of your total market index funds into individual stock picks</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s it, that&#39;s (in my opinion) the best way to get started in the stock market. Any additional tips from you guys?</p>\n\n<p>*These steps aren&#39;t actually necessary, you can just leave 100% of your capital in total market index funds and you will be fine, in fact that&#39;s what I would recommend you do but I realize that many people, especially those that come to this subreddit, would rather take their chances and try to outperform the market</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/n6a4a2/how_you_should_start_with_investing/","title":"How you should start with investing","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"May 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-06T22:32:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-06 22:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n6a4a2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n6a4a2/how_you_should_start_with_investing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n6a4a2/how_you_should_start_with_investing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"flobbley","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/flobbley","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"flobbley","score":60,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"どのように投資を始めるべきか","the_new_excerpt":"最近、投資を始めたばかりの人が、どうやって投資を始めればいいのかという投稿をたくさん見ました。\nまた、株式市場に参入したばかりの人が、大損してパニックになっているという投稿も多く見られます。\nまた、株式市場に参入して大損し、パニックに陥っている人の投稿も多く見られます。そのため、私は\n私が感じたことをお勧めするために、ちょっとした投稿をしてみようと思いました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你应该如何开始投资","the_new_excerpt":"我最近看到很多新投资者的帖子，询问他们应该如何开始投资，以及很多刚开始投资的人的帖子。\n的帖子，以及很多刚刚进入股市的人的帖子。\n进入股市，损失了很多钱，现在很恐慌。因此，我\n想到我只是发了一个快速的帖子，推荐我认为是......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你應該如何開始投資","the_new_excerpt":"我最近看到很多新投資者的帖子，詢問他們應該如何開始投資，以及很多剛開始投資的人的帖子。\n的帖子，以及很多剛剛進入股市的人的帖子。\n進入股市，損失了很多錢，現在很恐慌。因此，我\n想到我只是發了一個快速的帖子，推薦我認爲是......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n6b6yg","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6b6yg/not_quite_food_stamps_but_definitely_not_a_lambo/","title":"Not quite food stamps, but definitely not a lambo... 🤡","date":"May 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"フードスタンプとまではいきませんが、ランボとまではいきません...。🤡","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"不算是粮食券，但绝对不是兰博。🤡","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"不算是糧食券，但絕對不是蘭博。🤡","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-n6hl0h","excerpt":" * First quarter revenue totaled $138.1 million, representing an increase of 51%\n   year-over-year\n\n * Record dollar-based net retention of 123%, representing an increase of 600\n   basis points year-over-year\n\n * Strong large customer growth, with a record addition of roughly 120 large\n   customers…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/n6hl0h/cloudflare_net_announces_first_quarter_2021/","title":"Cloudflare ($NET) Announces First Quarter 2021 Financial Results","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"May 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"クラウドフレア（$NET）、2021年第1四半期の業績を発表","the_new_excerpt":" * 第1四半期の売上高は、51％増の138.1百万米ドルでした。\n   前年同期比\n\n * ドルベースのネット・リテンションは過去最高の123％で、前年同期比600ベーシスポイント増加\n   記録的なドルベースの顧客維持率123％、前年同期比600ベーシスポイント増\n\n * 大口顧客が大幅に増加し、過去最高となる約120社の大口顧客が追加された\n   好調な大口顧客の増加","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Cloudflare ($NET)公布2021年第一季度财报","the_new_excerpt":" * 第一季度收入总额为1.381亿美元，增加了51%。\n   增长51%。\n\n * 基于美元的净留存率达到创纪录的123%，同比增长600个基点\n   基点，同比增长600\n\n * 大客户增长强劲，创纪录地增加了大约120个大客户\n   大客户增长强劲，创纪录地增加了大约120个大客户......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Cloudflare ($NET)公佈2021年第一季度財報","the_new_excerpt":" * 第一季度收入總額爲1.381億美元，增加了51%。\n   增長51%。\n\n * 基於美元的淨留存率達到創紀錄的123%，同比增長600個基點\n   基點，同比增長600\n\n * 大客戶增長強勁，創紀錄地增加了大約120個大客戶\n   大客戶增長強勁，創紀錄地增加了大約120個大客戶......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-n6a4a2","previousId":"RedditPost-n6b6yg","nextId":"RedditPost-n6hl0h","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/n6a4a2/how_you_should_start_with_investing/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
