A couple years back I started an account with TDA for Pot stocks. I did fairly well, turned 1.5k into 7k. Sadly I didn&#39;t sell then. When I did sell it was at 4k. Needed cash to get an apartment with my preggo girlfriend. fast forward a few years and I see the GME news on YouTube, and bought a couple of shares. since then I&#39;ve been glued to my phone, bouncing between both TDA and Reddit. Well I&#39;m a member here, WSB, and Pennystocks. </p>\n\n<p>I know enough about the stock market to be dangerous. As in, dangerous to myself. I just want to know what to look for when investigating a company. Every fucking guide I&#39;ve seen seems abstract. using vague terminology and not really pointing to any direction. Some talk about P/E but don&#39;t really explain whats good P/E.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not looking for someone to do the work for me, but I need help. I want to know what to look for in a company. Like Market Cap vs Outstanding shares. I&#39;m not in any rush, I have time and want to learn. Can anyone help me?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lwj84t/how_to_dd_what_do_i_look_for_what_should_i_focus/","title":"How to DD, what do I look for? what should I focus on?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-03T12:59:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-03 12:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lwj84t","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lwj84t/how_to_dd_what_do_i_look_for_what_should_i_focus/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lwj84t/how_to_dd_what_do_i_look_for_what_should_i_focus/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"DrunkSpartan15","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DrunkSpartan15","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DrunkSpartan15","score":63,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如何DD，我看什么，我应该关注什么？","the_new_excerpt":"和很多人一样，我也跳上了GME的炒作。几年前，我开始了一个\n帐户与TDA的锅股票。我做得相当不错，把1.5k变成了7k。可悲的是，我\n当时没有卖掉。我卖的时候是4千块钱。需要现金来买房\n和我的未婚女友，快进几年了，我看到... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何DD，我看什麼，我應該關注什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"和很多人一樣，我也跳上了GME的炒作。幾年前，我開始了一個\n帳戶與TDA的鍋股票。我做得相當不錯，把1.5k變成了7k。可悲的是，我\n當時沒有賣掉。我賣的時候是4千塊錢。需要現金來買房\n和我的未婚女友，快進幾年了，我看到... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m7qyyy","excerpt":"I bought NVDA today, adding to a position I’d initiated in 2018 and have\ncontinuously added to on most dips.\n\nThe Bull Case\n\n * A great long term investment as demand for GPU’s will remain high for the\n   next decade\n * User markets such as data center, gaming and auto continue to grow\n * Leader in…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7qyyy/nvidia_nvda_is_a_great_long_term_investment/","title":"NVIDIA - $NVDA is a great long term investment","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"英伟达--$NVDA是一项伟大的长期投资。","the_new_excerpt":"我今天买入了NVDA，追加了我在2018年启动的仓位，并已\n在大多数跌幅上不断加。\n\n牛市案例\n\n * 由于未来对GPU的需求将持续高涨，因此是一项很好的长期投资。\n   下一个十年\n * 数据中心、游戏和汽车等用户市场持续增长。\n *领导在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"英偉達--$NVDA是一項偉大的長期投資。","the_new_excerpt":"我今天買入了NVDA，追加了我在2018年啓動的倉位，並已\n在大多數跌幅上不斷加。\n\n牛市案例\n\n * 由於未來對GPU的需求將持續高漲，因此是一項很好的長期投資。\n   下一個十年\n * 數據中心、遊戲和汽車等用戶市場持續增長。\n *領導在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m7ntcd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7ntcd/im_using_diamond_hands/","title":"I'm using Diamond Hands💎🙌","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 18, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我正在使用钻石手💎🙌。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我正在使用鑽石手💎🙌。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lwj84t","previousId":"RedditPost-m7qyyy","nextId":"RedditPost-m7ntcd","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lwj84t/how_to_dd_what_do_i_look_for_what_should_i_focus/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
