I find it extremely odd there are hardly any mentions of one of the literal biggest and oldest players in this field - Siemens Energy.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s like Reddit has a grudge against older established companies, and expects some new techy company to overtake them overnight. I really do not find this to be the case in this industry. For instance, a company like Siemens Energy has almost one hundred billion in backlog. Meaning, they have secure revenue streams for decades to come thanks to their long term service programs for their technologies. So again, I don&#39;t see them vanishing seemingly overnight because some young stud from california invents something they haven&#39;t. There&#39;s a good chance they might just buy it.</p>\n\n<p>The company just spun off into the only &quot;pure play&quot; energy company in the world, traded publicly. Unlike their primary competition, GE, they are not in financially troubling times, and have plenty of cash to do what they are aiming to do - reimagine themselves as a pure green energy company. They are the only company offering <strong>today</strong> conversions of gas fired plants to hydrogen fire (eliminating emissions), offer one of the biggest batteries in the world (through Fluence technology), have the largest installed fleet of wind turbines worldwide (Siemens Gamesa), and are on the leading technical edge for smart building, infrastructure, and grid stabilization projects.</p>\n\n<p>And yet...their stock price does hardly anything. Definitely did not benefit from the pump and dump nature other tech stocks have seen in the last 12 months. I just want to understand why?</p>\n\n<p>Edit to answer some common questions: SMEGF is ticker. Other tickets as well OTC around the world as it’s primarily traded on German stock exchange.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ms4np0/why_isnt_there_a_lot_of_discussion_about_siemens/","title":"Why isn't there a lot of discussion about Siemens Energy?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-16T23:13:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-16 23:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ms4np0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ms4np0/why_isnt_there_a_lot_of_discussion_about_siemens/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ms4np0/why_isnt_there_a_lot_of_discussion_about_siemens/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"PotcakeDog","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PotcakeDog","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"PotcakeDog","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"シーメンス・エナジーについては、なぜあまり話題にならないのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"グリーン・エネルギーのように見えますが、実際には燃料から加工まであらゆるエネルギー産業\n処理、発電、送配電、グリッド安定化、再生可能グリッド統合、スマートビルディングアプリケーションなど、あらゆるエネルギー産業が対象となります。\n系統安定化、再生可能エネルギーの統合、スマートビルディングへの応用などが\nRedditではすべての話題が取り上げられています。私は非常に奇妙なことに、ほとんど...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么没有很多关于西门子能源的讨论？","the_new_excerpt":"看来，绿色能源，真的是遍地的能源行业，从燃料到\n处理，到发电，到输配电，到电网\n稳定化、可再生电网一体化、智能建筑应用等都是\n都是Reddit上的热门话题。我觉得非常奇怪，几乎没有... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼沒有很多關於西門子能源的討論？","the_new_excerpt":"看來，綠色能源，真的是遍地的能源行業，從燃料到\n處理，到發電，到輸配電，到電網\n穩定化、可再生電網一體化、智能建築應用等都是\n都是Reddit上的熱門話題。我覺得非常奇怪，幾乎沒有... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mscxvp","excerpt":"I posted this as a comment in response to someone who said the whole GME saga\n\"made them sick\".
