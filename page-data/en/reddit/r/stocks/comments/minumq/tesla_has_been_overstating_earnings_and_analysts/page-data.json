Red flags abound.</p>\n\n<p>-Under new accounting, Tesla could recognize lease sale as regular revenue so long as the expected future fair market value (determined by Tesla) exceeded the guaranteed buyback price.</p>\n\n<p>-But looking closer at the description of these new leases, it seems tailor made to overestimate sales via financing agreemens (repos) with offshore entities. </p>\n\n<p>-Only problem is that cars depreciate. In a repo, you pay a higher price at the end of the term than you receive in initially, therefore any sales would have to be written off as the counterparty&#39;s &quot;put&quot; is int he money - indeed Tesla 1Q2019 wrote off $500M in sales.</p>\n\n<p>-To fix this problem, in 2Q2019 Elon and Tesla make the claim that the Model 3 is an &quot;Appreciating Asset&quot; based on its potential future FSD capabilities, providing public corroboration to underpin its accounting claim it was about to make</p>\n\n<p>-Setting the stage for Robotaxi Repo. By claiming the Model 3s were appreciating asset, they could recognize 100% of revenue for their excess production, without recognizing any offsetting liability or write downs as the estimated future value would exceed the buyback price.</p>\n\n<p>-Beginning in 2Q2019 Tesla &quot;Other&quot; international revenue mysteriously exploded, as its inventory dramatically shrank. From 2Q-4Q2019 these sales represented 36% of total Tesla revenue. Tesla stopped breaking out this category in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>-We estimate $2.5bn of Robotaxi repos took place over three quarters in 2019. Operating cash flow ex. this amount was negative. FCF was -$2.5bn vs $0.0bn as reported. This could have included up to about 100k cars or likely 10%-30% of 2019 deliveries depending on sales price.</p>\n\n<p>-All Teslas key metrics rebounded substantially from 1Q2019 and have remained strong going forward.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/minumq/tesla_has_been_overstating_earnings_and_analysts/","title":"Tesla has been overstating earnings and analysts have figured it out","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-02T21:42:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-02 21:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"minumq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/minumq/tesla_has_been_overstating_earnings_and_analysts/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/minumq/tesla_has_been_overstating_earnings_and_analysts/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"LegendLarrynumero1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LegendLarrynumero1","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"LegendLarrynumero1","score":78,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"特斯拉一直在高估盈利，分析师已经发现了这一点。","the_new_excerpt":"https://twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1/status/1377709751723827201\n\n-特斯拉在2018年分钟内达到规模化生产Model 3，导致Model 3规模庞大\n在处理预售积压时的销售情况\n\n-但到了2019年，产能超过了国内的需求，让特斯拉\n用多余的Model 3s，它需要... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉一直在高估盈利，分析師已經發現了這一點。","the_new_excerpt":"https://twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1/status/1377709751723827201\n\n-特斯拉在2018年分鐘內達到規模化生產Model 3，導致Model 3規模龐大\n在處理預售積壓時的銷售情況\n\n-但到了2019年，產能超過了國內的需求，讓特斯拉\n用多餘的Model 3s，它需要... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"},{"title":"Teslaは収益を過大に表示しており、アナリストはそれを把握している","the_new_excerpt":"https://twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1/status/1377709751723827201\n\n-テスラは2018年分にモデル3の大規模生産に到達し、巨大なモデル3につながる\n販売前のバックログを解消して販売\n\n-しかし、2019年には生産能力が国内需要を上回り、Teslaは余剰のModel 3を抱えることになります。\nしかし、2019年には生産能力が国内需要を上回り、Teslaは余ったModel 3を...","locale":"ja-JA"},{"title":"Teslaは収益を過大に表示しており、アナリストはそれを把握している","the_new_excerpt":"https://twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1/status/1377709751723827201\n\n-テスラは2018年分にモデル3の大規模生産に到達し、巨大なモデル3につながる\n販売前のバックログを解消して販売\n\n-しかし、2019年には生産能力が国内需要を上回り、Teslaは余剰のModel 3を抱えることになります。\nしかし、2019年には生産能力が国内需要を上回り、Teslaは余ったModel 3を...","locale":"ja"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n30y0q","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n30y0q/gme_yolo_what_could_go_wrong/","title":"GME Yolo.
