Not only are the videos of youtubers explaining what&#39;s going on increasing exponentially, but the incredible thing is that even influencers and youtubers completely outside the stock and financial game are talking about it.</p>\n\n<p>The consequence of this is that a lot of people are getting informed, they are trying to understand what is happening, why it is happening, and what are the rules and mechanisms that are permitting this situation.</p>\n\n<p>This wave of information is spreading at lightning speed financial concepts that have always remained obscure to most people.</p>\n\n<p>In short, ordinary people are opening their eyes. Financial education, albeit minimal, is beginning to be part of the cultural baggage of young and old alike. And this will have huge consequences in the future.</p>\n\n<p>This meme, and the whole GME situation, is opening the eyes to the world. I could compare it to the boost that the first trips to the moon gave to space engineering, or the boost to Karate gyms after the success of the movie Karate Kid, or the boost to medical culture that the pandemic that&#39;s hitting us is giving.</p>\n\n<p>This, gentlemen, is the major event that is revolutionizing economic culture from the ground up. And each one of you is a part of it. And each one of you will be able, one day, to proudly say &quot;f**k money, that time we were the protagonists&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Be honest: who else would have had such an opportunity to use money as a tool against the powerful market manipulators without GME?</p>\n\n<p>This is why what is happening is not a meme anymore. The world will be different afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr</p>\n\n<p>The GME Affair is changing the world&#39;s financial culture forever. No more financial ignorance, no more &quot;under the mattress&quot; investments. No more underhanded economic power plays.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l98jee/gme_end_financial_culture_how_this_meme_is/","title":"GME end financial culture: how this meme is becoming a serious thing","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-31T10:52:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-31 10:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l98jee","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l98jee/gme_end_financial_culture_how_this_meme_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l98jee/gme_end_financial_culture_how_this_meme_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"andreacento","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/andreacento","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"andreacento","score":21032,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME终结金融文化：这个备忘录是如何成为一件严肃的事情的？","the_new_excerpt":"这是对金融市场的第一次。\n赌徒\n并使投资者陷入贫困。\n\n至少，这是第一次发生在我的眼前，我可\n积极地成为其中的一部分。\n\n什么是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME終結金融文化：這個備忘錄是如何成爲一件嚴肅的事情的？","the_new_excerpt":"這是對金融市場的第一次。\n賭徒\n並使投資者陷入貧困。\n\n至少，這是第一次發生在我的眼前，我可\n積極地成爲其中的一部分。\n\n什麼是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lgzmme","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgzmme/candles_got_me_like/","title":"Candles got me like","date":"February 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"蜡烛让我喜欢","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"蠟燭讓我喜歡","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lgysbz","excerpt":"So this originally started with my interest in finding out 'what day of the week\nwas best to auto-invest in my M1 account'.
