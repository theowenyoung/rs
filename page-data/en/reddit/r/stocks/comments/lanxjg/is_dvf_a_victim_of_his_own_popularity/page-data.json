Given that WSB has a few inadequate members who might threaten DFV’s safety, if something goes wrong. As DFV just became a public person and his name and other personal details are widely known, this becomes even trickier.</p>\n\n<p>I might be downvoted, but a fact that I saw people in WSB calling a little kid who sold his GME shares (from the recent news) “a little c*nt” just pisses me off as this crosses all the borders.</p>\n\n<p>Hope, nothing terrible happens to DFV and he pulls out from GME at the right time without raising to much hate from his followers. I guess loosing his reputation is also something that he might not want, but are millions a good price for being called a legend of a Reddit community?</p>\n\n<p>What would you do if you were in his shoes?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: made a typo in the title, supposed to be DFV</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lanxjg/is_dvf_a_victim_of_his_own_popularity/","title":"Is DVF a victim of his own popularity?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T19:47:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 19:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lanxjg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lanxjg/is_dvf_a_victim_of_his_own_popularity/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lanxjg/is_dvf_a_victim_of_his_own_popularity/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"lebrokholic","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lebrokholic","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"lebrokholic","score":70,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"DVF是自己人气的受害者吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我有一种感觉，在获得如此多的关注之后，u/deepfuckingvalue。\n[/u/deepfuckingvalue]陷入了自己的人气陷阱，有问题的任何\n公众可能拥有的，特别是当很多人的财富都是依赖的时候。\n对他的决定。\n\n他一定有一个两难的选择：他卖的太...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DVF是自己人氣的受害者嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我有一種感覺，在獲得如此多的關注之後，u/deepfuckingvalue。\n[/u/deepfuckingvalue]陷入了自己的人氣陷阱，有問題的任何\n公衆可能擁有的，特別是當很多人的財富都是依賴的時候。\n對他的決定。\n\n他一定有一個兩難的選擇：他賣的太...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-liwxrz","excerpt":"Brothers, sisters, bisters, and sothers.\n\nWe come today to pay tribute to our good friend Keith Gill a.k.a. the messenger\nof the god of retards known as DFV.\n\nIn the next week Congress and their wife's boyfriend will be questioning our\nbeloved Keith Gill why he didn't use lube after destroying…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liwxrz/keith_gill_deepfuckingvalue_tribute/","title":"Keith Gill / DeepFuckingValue Tribute","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Keith Gill / DeepFuckingValue Tribute","the_new_excerpt":"兄弟姐妹们，姐妹们，母亲们。\n\n我们今天是来向我们的好朋友基思-吉尔又名信使致敬的。\n被称为DFV的弱智之神。\n\n在下周，国会和他们妻子的男友将质疑我们的。\n心爱的基思-吉尔为什么在毁掉之后不用润滑油... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Keith Gill / DeepFuckingValue Tribute","the_new_excerpt":"兄弟姐妹們，姐妹們，母親們。\n\n我們今天是來向我們的好朋友基思-吉爾又名信使致敬的。\n被稱爲DFV的弱智之神。\n\n在下週，國會和他們妻子的男友將質疑我們的。\n心愛的基思-吉爾爲什麼在毀掉之後不用潤滑油... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lit39w","excerpt":"🦍 Ape bought $10M worth of GME near the peak of its Reddit-hype, the position\nis now worth $2M\n\n🦍 Ape also bought $1M in AMC and $1M in Silver\n\n\n\nArticle (trimmed):\n\nSun, the 30 year-old entrepreneur who bought $10 million worth of GameStop Corp.\nat the height of its Reddit-fueled rally, is…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lit39w/autist_rich_asian_ape_bought_10m_of_gme_near_its/","title":"Autist Rich Asian: Ape bought $10M of GME near its peak ($8M Loss)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 13, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"自闭症富豪亚洲人。猩猩在高峰期附近买入1000万的金交所（亏损800万）。","the_new_excerpt":"🦍猿在Reddit-hype高峰期附近买入了价值1000万美元的GME，这个仓位\n现在价值200万\n\n🦍猿也买了100万美金的AMC和100万美金的Silver。\n\n\n\n文章（被删减）。\n\n孙，30岁的企业家谁买了1000万美元的价值GameStop公司。\n在Reddit推动的涨势最猛烈的时候，30岁的企业家孙先生正...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"自閉症富豪亞洲人。猩猩在高峯期附近買入1000萬的金交所（虧損800萬）。","the_new_excerpt":"🦍猿在Reddit-hype高峯期附近買入了價值1000萬美元的GME，這個倉位\n現在價值200萬\n\n🦍猿也買了100萬美金的AMC和100萬美金的Silver。\n\n\n\n文章（被刪減）。\n\n孫，30歲的企業家誰買了1000萬美元的價值GameStop公司。\n在Reddit推動的漲勢最猛烈的時候，30歲的企業家孫先生正...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lanxjg","previousId":"RedditPost-liwxrz","nextId":"RedditPost-lit39w","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lanxjg/is_dvf_a_victim_of_his_own_popularity/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
