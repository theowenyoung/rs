For every random post you see of someone claiming to have made a fortune on an individual stock, there are 40 people who tried and failed, and just didn’t post about it.</p>\n\n<p>Most new traders see that the market is raging and think they can jump into investing and become rich in 3 months by just buying and selling off an initial $5k investment a few times. Here’s the reality: proper investing takes time (patience), discipline (holding), and work (research). For 90%+ of people, your best strategy is in ETFs.</p>\n\n<p>For 100% of people, your best strategy is putting the core of your portfolio in ETFs. Your investments in individual stocks should ONLY be a supplement—ie buying high conviction, high upside plays that won’t damage your portfolio’s stability if you lose. The number of people out there who seem to think a portfolio with 50% PLTR is a legitimate investment strategy is extremely alarming, and they are going to end up losing a lot of money. Maybe not on that stock, but on one of them as they continue down that path.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to invest, you should take the time to read John Bogle’s “little book of common sense investing” to understand why ETFs always beat 90%+ of investment strategies. Also everyone should read Benjamin Graham’s “Intelligent Investor”. If you don’t have time, why would you think you have time to invest?</p>\n\n<p>The distilled version is that the market always broadly goes up in the long term, buying and holding a diversified s&amp;p500 ETF with very low fees (like VOO) is the surest way to guarantee your fair share of returns. Almost everyone on this sub would have better returns over 30 years if they did nothing but that. But of course, that isn’t fun for people.</p>\n\n<p>But know this—the market will come down from here. It is trading well above value. If your money is disproportionately in individual stocks, you have no guarantee of it coming back.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re new to investing out at least 90% of your money in VOO and leave it alone. Forever. The rest you can take shots at individual stocks with. When you add money to your portfolio, add at least 50% to VOO and then with the left over you can buy individual stocks. Do this for AT LEAST a year, but 3 would be better.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re experienced you don’t need me to tell you this but 60% of yours portfolio should still be in ETFs.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck out there. I don’t know when it will come down, but it will.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: after some people calling me a “boomer” and questioning my selection, I’ll provide disclosures. It’s true that I do not own only ETFs. But I have been investing for a lot while. A bit over 60% of my portfolio is in ETFs or holding companies (BRKB)</p>\n\n<p>VGT\nVCR\nTTD\nBRKB\nVOO\nARKG\nFKASX\nROKU\nARKF\nFUBO\nSHOP\nCRM\nPIN\nSQ\nMTCH\nPYPL\nFVRR\nZ\nDIS\nNFLX\nPTON\nNVDA\nCRWD\nDOCU\nZM\nTWLO\nABNB\nLMD\nWIX\nRDFN\nAI\nFSLY</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lnmd7h/new_traders_the_internet_is_loaded_with_bad/","title":"NEW TRADERS: The internet is loaded with bad advice on buying individual stocks—your core portfolio should be built on old principles","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-19T19:33:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-19 19:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lnmd7h","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnmd7h/new_traders_the_internet_is_loaded_with_bad/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnmd7h/new_traders_the_internet_is_loaded_with_bad/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"bro8619","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bro8619","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bro8619","score":1084,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"新交易者：互联网上充斥着关于购买个股的错误建议--你的核心投资组合应该建立在旧的原则之上。","the_new_excerpt":"我在Reddit、Twitter和社交媒体上看到的都是对泛滥的不良建议。\n新的交易者进入市场的权利。你每看到一个随机的帖子\n有人说自己在一只股票上赚了钱，有40只\n人谁尝试和失败， 只是没有发布有关它。\n\n大多数...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"新交易者：互聯網上充斥着關於購買個股的錯誤建議--你的核心投資組合應該建立在舊的原則之上。","the_new_excerpt":"我在Reddit、Twitter和社交媒體上看到的都是對氾濫的不良建議。\n新的交易者進入市場的權利。你每看到一個隨機的帖子\n有人說自己在一隻股票上賺了錢，有40只\n人誰嘗試和失敗， 只是沒有發佈有關它。\n\n大多數...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ly4nd9","excerpt":"Since last summer I'd been doing multiple buys and sells virtually every single\ntrading day.
