I agree that this bill is going to affect the shady Chinese companies, but the already established ones like $BABA, $JD, ,$NIO, $LI, $XPEV etc. should not be impacted at all. Rather, in my opinion, they are more likely to benefit from this bill because of the probable redistribution of funds in favor of them.</p>\n\n<p>The author of the article has considerable positions in an inverse ETF that benefits from the downfall of Chinese companies [this information is disclosed at the end of the article]. So, it is pretty obvious that he and his allies are trying to create confusion by fabricating the truth in order to save their backs. </p>\n\n<p>DON&#39;T fall for this scam!
