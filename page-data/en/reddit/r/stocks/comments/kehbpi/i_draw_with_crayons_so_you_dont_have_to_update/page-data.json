On Sunday I released <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kclawm/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_last_week/\">the stocks on my watchlist</a> for the week and entered all of them come Monday. The only one I sold shortly after was HYLN for a $60 loss. In the end I decided to avoid that ticker. I also had a position entered on NIO, which was another EV play.</p>\n\n<p>My account hit $90k today. When I began these posts I think 6 weeks ago, I was only at $75k. Hopefully can continue moving on up with the same returns moving forward.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the fact most my positions are still in the green of 20-30%. I foresee myself holding them until next week. It&#39;s also going to be the holidays so my trading will be light. I&#39;ll still make a short list of stocks this Sunday that I will be keeping an eye on though!</p>\n\n<p>Positions from this week still open: <strong>CODX, OSTK, U, WKHS, NIO</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to be looking to hold these for another 2-7 days and hopefully close them all out at +70% profit. We will see.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks everyone who&#39;s been following this journey from the start. Thanks to the haters that thought my plays were dumb too, made me really be sure to enter these positions before I did.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/VU2zQiU\">Positions</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kehbpi/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_update/","title":"I draw with crayons so you don't have to.
