Aren’t after hour trading hours determined by a broker and could theoretically be extended to all hours of the day? Or say a company/website that deals in “contracts” where you can sell your right to a stock you own at any point after close and then it fills as soon as the market actually opens the next morning. The price paid for this “contract” would be what someone thinks the value of the stock is worth at that point (matched with someone selling for what they think it’s worth), the same as putting a bid on the actual stock market during open hours being matched with an ask. Theoretically if enough people join in, the price of these “contracts” would have an influence on the opening price of the stock the next day because you know what people would be theoretically willing to pay for a stock at all hours. It would be like if the stock market was open 24/7 365. In the age of the internet I don’t see a reason why this couldn’t be possible, but I would love to hear what people think about this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/knj03a/what_in_theory_is_stopping_the_market_from_being/","title":"What, in theory, is stopping the market from being open 24/7?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"December 31, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-31T13:46:02.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-31 13:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"knj03a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/knj03a/what_in_theory_is_stopping_the_market_from_being/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/knj03a/what_in_theory_is_stopping_the_market_from_being/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TheOssBoss","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheOssBoss","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"TheOssBoss","score":76,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"从理论上讲，是什么阻止了市场全天候开放？","the_new_excerpt":"很明显，实际的市场只会在上午9：30到下午4：00开放，但是什么是开放的呢？\n阻止外部经纪人/服务/网站全天候开放？不是在追寻\n小时交易时间由经纪人决定，理论上可以延长到\n一天中的所有时间？或者比方说一家经营…业务的公司/网站","locale":"zh"},{"title":"從理論上講，是什麼阻止了市場全天候開放？","the_new_excerpt":"很明顯，實際的市場只會在上午9：30到下午4：00開放，但是什麼是開放的呢？\n阻止外部經紀人/服務/網站全天候開放？不是在追尋\n小時交易時間由經紀人決定，理論上可以延長到\n一天中的所有時間？或者比方說一家經營…業務的公司/網站","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l28375","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l28375/well_done_guys/","title":"Well done guys! 🚀🚀🚀🚀","date":"January 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"干得好，伙计们 🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"幹得好，夥計們 🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l2d1wp","excerpt":"COMPANY OVERVIEW\n\nPalantir technologies is an American software company founded in 2003 and\nheadquartered in Colorado that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nThey started building software for the intelligence community in the US to\nassist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l2d1wp/complete_pltr_dd_ahead_of_demo_day_valuation/","title":"Complete PLTR DD ahead of Demo Day (Valuation Included)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 22, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"在演示日之前完成PLTR DD（包括估值）。","the_new_excerpt":"公司概述\n\nPalantir技术公司是一家美国软件公司，成立于2003年，是一家专业的软件公司。\n总部位于科罗拉多州，专门从事大数据分析的公司。\n\n他们开始为美国的情报界打造软件，以?\n协助反恐调查，帮助他们查明.。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在演示日之前完成PLTR DD（包括估值）。","the_new_excerpt":"公司概述\n\nPalantir技術公司是一家美國軟件公司，成立於2003年，是一家專業的軟件公司。\n總部位於科羅拉多州，專門從事大數據分析的公司。\n\n他們開始爲美國的情報界打造軟件，以?\n協助反恐調查，幫助他們查明.。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-knj03a","previousId":"RedditPost-l28375","nextId":"RedditPost-l2d1wp","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/knj03a/what_in_theory_is_stopping_the_market_from_being/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
