They don&#39;t like the fact their Suezmax ships are old and think their book value is overstated due to the age of their ships. Book value doesn&#39;t mean much for an operating company that&#39;s not in danger of bankruptcy. It&#39;s profits, cashflow and ability to service debt that really counts. They&#39;re able to keep these old ships running, even using the latest low sulphur fuels and pay most profits earned as dividends. They&#39;re basically the slumlords of tankers and if you&#39;ve ever been involved in real estate, you know those slums cash flow much better than Trump level properties.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, tanker stocks generally suck and tanker gang got burned after oil futures trading returned to normal.</p>\n\n<p>We like short dated options plays on the tanker with the greatest meme power.</p>\n\n<p>Do what you will with this information. This is gambling, not investing and we don&#39;t provide financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/menfzk/tanker_gang_rise_up_a_repeat_of_2020/","title":"Tanker Gang Rise Up; a Repeat of 2020?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-28T02:54:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-28 02:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"menfzk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/menfzk/tanker_gang_rise_up_a_repeat_of_2020/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/menfzk/tanker_gang_rise_up_a_repeat_of_2020/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"bannercoin","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bannercoin","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bannercoin","score":142,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"坦克帮崛起；2020年重演？","the_new_excerpt":"首先，查看https://istheshipstillstuck.com/，如果答案是 \"是\"，在\n周一上午，看油轮股的走势。\n\n去年4月，石油期货出现阴跌，这造就了 \"油轮帮\"。射击\n到备忘录的状态是一个油轮股票，$ NAT和股票从3元/股以下运行\n到...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"坦克幫崛起；2020年重演？","the_new_excerpt":"首先，查看https://istheshipstillstuck.com/，如果答案是 \"是\"，在\n週一上午，看油輪股的走勢。\n\n去年4月，石油期貨出現陰跌，這造就了 \"油輪幫\"。射擊\n到備忘錄的狀態是一個油輪股票，$ NAT和股票從3元/股以下運行\n到...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1385702764681080835","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1385702764681080835","title":"When a stock corrects, you will find out who has done their homework, and who was piggybacking.","date":"April 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"銘柄が修正されると、誰が宿題をしていたのか、誰がおんぶにだっこだったのかがわかります。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"当一只股票纠正时，你会发现谁做了功课，谁在搭便车。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"當一隻股票糾正時，你會發現誰做了功課，誰在搭便車。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mxo1oz","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mxo1oz/deutsche_bank_whistleblower_vanishes/","title":"Deutsche Bank Whistleblower Vanishes","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 24, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ドイツ銀行の内部告発者が失踪","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"德意志银行的举报人消失了","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"德意志銀行的舉報人消失了","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-menfzk","previousId":"TweetPost-1385702764681080835","nextId":"RedditPost-mxo1oz","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/menfzk/tanker_gang_rise_up_a_repeat_of_2020/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
