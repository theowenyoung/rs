I started about 1.5 years ago but before i put money into the stock market i read 3 books and played with paper money beforehand. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I absolutely love going to reddit for stock information. I visit about 7 subs daily and i also watch YouTube videos daily. So by no means am I saying you shouldn’t do that. </p>\n\n<p>But in my opinion the reasons to visit these forums is to: \n1.  Get ideas for stocks to &lt;research yourself&gt;.\n2.  Engage socially with people that share your interest in investing. For example, i have no people in my real life circle that even know what stocks are. So i use reddit to engage socially with likeminded individuals.</p>\n\n<p>But in no way should you visit these forums  for sound advice that you trust and don’t have the ability to fact check with your own DD. \nSometimes people give amazing insight and ideas on these forums but if you don’t know to read a balance sheet and in general, research the company yourself- you are using these resources wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Just my two cents, if anyone feels like what I’ve said applies to them. I can send you online free book links and help with any questions you have, just PM me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/loy1qg/many_of_you_new_investors_have_to_reevaluate_what/","title":"Many of you new investors have to reevaluate what online stock forums are for.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T15:22:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 15:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"loy1qg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loy1qg/many_of_you_new_investors_have_to_reevaluate_what/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loy1qg/many_of_you_new_investors_have_to_reevaluate_what/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Ifrezznew","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ifrezznew","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Ifrezznew","score":1050,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"很多新股民都要重新评估网上股票论坛是干什么的。","the_new_excerpt":"我也是投资新手。我开始大约1.5年前，但之前我把我的投资。\n钱进入股市，我读了3本书，玩纸币\n事先。\n\n现在，我绝对喜欢去reddit查询股票信息。我访问约7\n子每天，我也看YouTube视频每天。所以，由不...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"很多新股民都要重新評估網上股票論壇是幹什麼的。","the_new_excerpt":"我也是投資新手。我開始大約1.5年前，但之前我把我的投資。\n錢進入股市，我讀了3本書，玩紙幣\n事先。\n\n現在，我絕對喜歡去reddit查詢股票信息。我訪問約7\n子每天，我也看YouTube視頻每天。所以，由不...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lzav70","excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/06/covid-stimulus-update-senate-passes-1point9-trillion-relief-bill.html\n\nThe US Senate just passed the 1.9T pandemic relief bill after negotiating with a\ncentrist Democrat for the final vote to break the 50-50 tie.\n\nAfter a month of a downtrend in equities, on Friday,…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lzav70/breaking_us_senate_votes_to_pass_19t_pandemic/","title":"Breaking: US Senate votes to pass 1.9T pandemic relief bill, positive outlook on equities","date":"March 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"突发事件。美国参议院投票通过1.9T疫情救助法案，对股市前景看好。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/06/covid-stimulus-update-senate-passes-1point9-trillion-relief-bill.html\n\n美国参议院刚刚通过了1.9T疫情救助法案，在与一个\n中间派民主党人进行最后投票，以打破50-50的平局。\n\n在经历了一个月的股市下跌趋势后，上周五，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"突發事件。美國參議院投票通過1.9T疫情救助法案，對股市前景看好。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/06/covid-stimulus-update-senate-passes-1point9-trillion-relief-bill.html\n\n美國參議院剛剛通過了1.9T疫情救助法案，在與一個\n中間派民主黨人進行最後投票，以打破50-50的平局。\n\n在經歷了一個月的股市下跌趨勢後，上週五，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lz77ix","excerpt":"Below I've calculated the short float and short % of shares outstanding based on\nthe total shares owned by institutions and insiders based on Finra\n[https://finra…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz77ix/gme_total_shares_owned_is_145m_according_to_finra/","title":"GME total shares owned is 145M+ according to FINRA.
