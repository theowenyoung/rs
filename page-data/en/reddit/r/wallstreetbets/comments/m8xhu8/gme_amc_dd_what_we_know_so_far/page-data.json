So please take what I say here with a grain of salt. Just know that just like yourselves, I&#39;m balls deep in the GME // AMC phenomenon, and the past two months have been the most interesting in all of my life.</p>\n\n<p>Also, please note that I&#39;m on a laptop, so I&#39;ll likely come back and edit this to make it look more enjoyable on a phone. Please forgive the lack of [rocket emoji]s! </p>\n\n<p>EDITED TO REMOVE POSITIONS</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve also been swinging option calls on the side, getting burned this week as I was hoping we&#39;d get a push to 300.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A BRIEF LOOK BACK</strong></p>\n\n<p>So as we all know, GameStop took off in January. A lot went into it, and a hero was born. We know him as <a href=\"/r/DeepF\">r/DeepF</a>*ckingValue, otherwise known as RoaringKitty on YouTube and Twitter. His ape name is Keith Gill, and was recently put in the hot seat at the recent Hearing regarding the trading halts that occurred in January, which ultimately prevented the squeeze from being squoze by eliminating a vast percentage of buying pressure. </p>\n\n<p>He likes the stock, but is not recommending that we buy it. He&#39;s recommending that we do our own DD, and dive into the rabbit hole of a crooked-fucked market ran by greed and manipulation that we&#39;ve been watching day in, and day out for the past two months now, and the mess that they&#39;ve created regarding short interest, failed to delivers, etc.</p>\n\n<p>AMC happened to be in the mix during all this, and up to this point has survived as capable, and has saved AMC entirely. </p>\n\n<p>Both of these stocks have a great support system behind them, and that in and of itself is why we will not fail.</p>\n\n<p>All we have to do is put up with the bullshit that is coming our way, and man, it&#39;s quite spectacular the lengths that these hedgefucks are willing to go to in order to try and shake us out of our positions.</p>\n\n<p>ITS NOT FUCKING WORKING.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WHERE ARE WE NOW?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here we fucking are, March of 2021, and GameStop is trading at $200/share after reaching a peak of $350 last week before the stoploss jerkfest of the century took place. </p>\n\n<p>AMC has been receiving great news as of late, and has had a lot of insider buying taking place that points to positive outlook moving forward. They now have 98% of theatres open, and the remaining will follow suit later this month.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a list of positive reasons why we need to hold on to these two stocks until this event plays out, as I really believe that we&#39;re about to witness something that has never been seen before in the world of finance. </p>\n\n<p>Remember, apes, when in doubt, remember these things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The hedgefunds are BLATANTLY manipulating the system in their favor using various methods such as naked shorting, short laddering, bid/ask spread manipulation, etc. Why would they be performing all of this fuckery? Because we have them by the balls. All we have to do is continue to buy and hold until they destroy themselves from the inside out.</p></li>\n<li><p>A news article was released today stating that the Fed will no longer be providing &quot;Emergency Relief&quot; to big banks on Wal Street. Interesting timing, don&#39;t you think? A link to this article can be found here:  <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-end-emergency-capital-relief-for-big-banks-11616158811\">Federal Reserve to End Emergency Capital Relief for Big Banks - WSJ</a> </p></li>\n<li><p>We&#39;ve determined Robinhood needs to be crucified, as all they&#39;ve done is essentially take your money, data, and export it to a third party for insane amounts of cash, all while providing bogus shares to its&#39; customers, and while causing the trading halt that prevented the squeeze in January. HOWEVER! Think of what this means. They fucked up big time. Not only did this action spark an investigation into their fuckery, but has also lead to two Hearings, with a third to follow. Not sure if anything will come of it, but the best part and silver lining is that ROBINHOOD IS NOW EXPOSED TO RETAIL TRADERS LIKE YOU AND I. They&#39;re the first domino in this corrupt witch-hunt to fall, and they won&#39;t be the last. Not only that, but now the squeeze will be even bigger than it could&#39;ve been before, which will make for more tendies. :)</p></li>\n<li><p>There has been a DTCC rule change that will go into effect at some point. If someone has some information on this that is VERIFIABLE, please share, as there seems to be no clear cut answer for when and if this rule has been taken into effect. In a nutshell, the rule change is allowing the DTCC to have daily calls to determine short positions, and the second part would allow the DTCC to forcibly liquidate any short positions that they feel would be too risky or abusive in nature. THIS IS HUGE. If it comes to fruition? We&#39;ll have to wait and see.</p></li>\n<li><p>GME has an earnings report that is due next week. If they crush EPS, I strongly feel this could potentially be a catalyst going into next week. </p></li>\n<li><p>Bots and shills have been filling the comment sections trying to get us out of our positions. Why the fuck would they be doing this? Because again, they&#39;re desperate, and will do anything for your shares, because they know they&#39;ll be way more expensive as time progresses. Ignore these fucks. Block them, and move on with your day. If you read ANY NEGATIVE NEWS about GME or AMC via comments, always verify that they&#39;re at least not a bot/shill first. Let the hedgefunds waste their money there.</p></li>\n<li><p>DFV IS STILL HOLDING. If he&#39;s still in it, we&#39;re still in it. Look to his tweets.</p></li>\n<li><p>Both of these companies are doing great things for their business, shareholders, and future outlook. We should all be excited, and come together during this time and find support through each other. If we hold tight and ride this wave together, we cannot falter. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We&#39;re living something spectacular right now, apes, and the progress we&#39;ve made up to this point is simply astonishing given the forces that we&#39;re up against.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m here to ride this thing until the end, and I hope you all are too. Let&#39;s keep each other in the loop, and find ways to collaboratively take back from these greedy shits what has belonged to us since they first took it back in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>To the hedgefunds? I hope you&#39;re scared. I hope you&#39;re nervous. I hope that you see the way of life you&#39;ve so selfishly lived crumbling around you, as the average Joe takes back what is his, and with a burning vengeance. You can keep trying to cheat, steal, and manipulate your way to our shares, but the vast majority of our effort has become more resilient than you can tolerate.  If you read this, just know that you&#39;re fucked, and nobody is going to come running to save your ass this time. </p>\n\n<p>To all my fellow apes? Hold strong, warriors. That is what you truly are. </p>\n\n<p>[rocketemoji][rocketemoji][rocketemoji][rocketemoji][rocketemoji][rocketemoji]</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🍌🍌</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Less retarded format</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8xhu8/gme_amc_dd_what_we_know_so_far/","title":"GME & AMC DD, WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-20T13:26:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-20 13:26","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m8xhu8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8xhu8/gme_amc_dd_what_we_know_so_far/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8xhu8/gme_amc_dd_what_we_know_so_far/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/VGnkuTXl-_7__-EgrLjsMWwCXwxwydsF0Pr2DoAdbUs.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fef645de5aa64596064773460e69a6757fabda4c","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Horror_Veterinar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Horror_Veterinar","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Horror_Veterinar","score":2516,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME和AMC DD，目前我们所知道的情况。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n在我开始之前，让我先说一句，我绝不是... ...\n理财顾问，事实上可能是法律上的弱智。所以，请把我的\n在这里说与一粒盐。你要知道，就像你们一样，我也是个蛋蛋。\n深入GME//AMC现象，以及过去的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME和AMC DD，目前我們所知道的情況。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n在我開始之前，讓我先說一句，我絕不是... ...\n理財顧問，事實上可能是法律上的弱智。所以，請把我的\n在這裏說與一粒鹽。你要知道，就像你們一樣，我也是個蛋蛋。\n深入GME//AMC現象，以及過去的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mprcos","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mprcos/im_not_fucking_leaving/","title":"I’M NOT FUCKING LEAVING!!!!!!!","date":"April 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"I'm not fucking leaving!!!!!!!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我不会他妈的离开!!!!!!!。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我不會他媽的離開!!!!!!!。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mpn0td","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mpn0td/i_aint_ever_selling/","title":"I ain’t ever selling","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 13, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"売る気はありません。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我是不会卖的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我是不會賣的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m8xhu8","previousId":"RedditPost-mprcos","nextId":"RedditPost-mpn0td","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8xhu8/gme_amc_dd_what_we_know_so_far/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
