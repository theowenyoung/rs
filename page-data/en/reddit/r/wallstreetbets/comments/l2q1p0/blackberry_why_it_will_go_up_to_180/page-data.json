Now take that evaluation and add that to everything BlackBerry already does...and you will have BlackBerry’s true future evaluation...BlackBerry is no longer a phone company but a cyber security company, and it competitors only in the security business (have a market cap of 50 billion) and they are not in the vehicle business that I outlined above for BlackBerry. (BlackBerry is in both). BlackBerry’s market cap is only at 7 billion, yes only 7 billion...it should be at 100 billion, because stocks are supposed to be investments for future earnings...100 billion market cap would put BlackBerry at a share price of $180 US ...crowdstrike which earns the same amount as BlackBerry is at a 50 billion market cap, and if you evaluate the vehicle side of BlackBerry and Amazon partnership to be 50 billion dollars additional market cap (I believe it’s worth more) then you have 50 + 50 = 100 billion market cap evaluation</p>\n\n<p>*(Adding rockets, been told the post does not have enough rockets haha)</p>\n\n<p>BlackBerry to the MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌙+ two more 🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>*Edit #2 (FYI, I’ll be posting a video on Monday stating why BlackBerry is so undervalued and what are the catalyst for its future growth (reasons why it should be valued so high)...I wasn’t able to say it all in my original post because if I made it too long, maybe people would have not read it) my Twitter handle is @Wealthy_Mindset and my YouTube channel is Wealthy Mindset (YouTube will be hard to find since I have yet to post a video)....<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0vQkNYuitns-aMNj3otsg\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0vQkNYuitns-aMNj3otsg</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2q1p0/blackberry_why_it_will_go_up_to_180/","title":"BlackBerry (why it will go up to $180 🚀)","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-23T05:59:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-23 05:59","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l2q1p0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2q1p0/blackberry_why_it_will_go_up_to_180/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2q1p0/blackberry_why_it_will_go_up_to_180/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/Ltvek2cqLgX-A_uqChdKQqvgSV4Ctts5TeyQ3MwRd3I.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=16458c4c1afd457c1e8629a9b17edbe993f28421","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"oli735","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/oli735","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"oli735","score":2121,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"黑莓（为什么会涨到180美元🚀）。","the_new_excerpt":"如果我告诉你有一家公司，将操作系统和。\n所有车辆的通信标准，无论他们是否是电动汽车或。\n2023年开始自主或不自主车辆及以上，同时为其提供安全保障。\n并将收集到的数据进行存储（感谢亚马逊队...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"黑莓（爲什麼會漲到180美元🚀）。","the_new_excerpt":"如果我告訴你有一家公司，將操作系統和。\n所有車輛的通信標準，無論他們是否是電動汽車或。\n2023年開始自主或不自主車輛及以上，同時爲其提供安全保障。\n並將收集到的數據進行存儲（感謝亞馬遜隊...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lbh05m","excerpt":"Hi all,\n\nI'd like to explain why I believe LMND is currently overvalued, and encourage\nyou to please poke holes in my arguments.
