Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning.

But we haven&#39;t won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won&#39;t see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it&#39;s still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk.
