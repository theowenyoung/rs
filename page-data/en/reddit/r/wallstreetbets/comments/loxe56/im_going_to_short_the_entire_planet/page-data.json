I&#39;ve been dabbling in galaxy futures for awhile now and trust me I know what I am talking about. </p>\n\n<p>The Fundamentals:</p>\n\n<p>At the time of writing this, the current world population is 7,874,964,825. If you divide that number by the population of South Africa (58.56 million) you get ~134. On January 26, 2021 at approximately 2:30PM, GameStop hit a stock price of $134.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mjhmx2jqnri61.png?width=479&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24cbe35d5f29be3f14750a09e2c6603496e47ef5\">GameStop first passes $134</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As you know, 2:30PM in military time is 1430. 1430 just happens to be a radio station called KMRB in Pasadena, California. Pasadena has a population of ~141k and if you divide that by 2.66 (The average daily % gain AMC had in early January) you get ~53k. </p>\n\n<p>Want to guess what 53k is? It&#39;s the population of Grapevine, Texas.. where the <a href=\"https://www.corporate-office-headquarters.com/gamestop-corp\">GameStop Headquarters</a> is located. </p>\n\n<p>The exact coordinates are 32.9343° N, 97.0781° W. Meaning we only have ~33 days, 97 minutes left before a possible beginning of the collapse of the entire system.</p>\n\n<p>My plan is to bet against 51% of each continent and 89% of each major ocean using a forward triple straddle tampon fluid structure.</p>\n\n<p>I will then double down on the negative sentiment momentum using a food shortage wall and a shoots and ladders attack to prevent the price from going back up.</p>\n\n<p>I will report back here with the results. This isn&#39;t a short term trade. I&#39;m waiting for the sun to reach critical mass and send solar flares into our atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: </p>\n\n<p>420,690  1200° Fahrenheit naked puts 3/26</p>\n\n<p>690,420  1400° Fahrenheit naked puts 4/16</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loxe56/im_going_to_short_the_entire_planet/","title":"I'm going to short the entire planet.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T18:22:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 18:22","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"loxe56","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loxe56/im_going_to_short_the_entire_planet/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loxe56/im_going_to_short_the_entire_planet/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/KQmCkzLGYyxsS0Sm4YiwyzMKDOel_jXwnz4hf0KFG-s.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0ce849668d16174861ee8cbc07a9794647bb6374","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"mognetron","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mognetron","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"mognetron","score":5755,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我要做空整个地球。","the_new_excerpt":"我向你保证，这并不容易。但从各方面来看，这个星球是\n搞砸了 我一直在研究星系的未来，相信我，我知道。\n我说的是什么。\n\n的基本原理。\n\n在写这篇文章的时候，目前世界人口是7,874,964,825。如果\n你把它分成...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我要做空整個地球。","the_new_excerpt":"我向你保證，這並不容易。但從各方面來看，這個星球是\n搞砸了 我一直在研究星系的未來，相信我，我知道。\n我說的是什麼。\n\n的基本原理。\n\n在寫這篇文章的時候，目前世界人口是7,874,964,825。如果\n你把它分成...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lysyvn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lysyvn/how_stonks_are_born/","title":"How Stonks are Born","date":"March 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"石头人是如何诞生的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"石頭人是如何誕生的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lzbh46","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzbh46/gme_realistic_price_prediction_dd/","title":"GME realistic price prediction DD","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME现实价格预测DD","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME現實價格預測DD","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-loxe56","previousId":"RedditPost-lysyvn","nextId":"RedditPost-lzbh46","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loxe56/im_going_to_short_the_entire_planet/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
