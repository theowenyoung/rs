If you think Robinhood sounds bad, eToro is Vlad&#39;s haircut level of fucked.   </p>\n\n<p>The solution to the problem, in eToro&#39;s eyes, is now to increase the minimum deposit for new users (up to $1,000 from $250 earlier this year), and to stop allowing placing order requests for market open. Not to increase server capacity, just to squeeze people a little more. Withdrawal requests already were a travesty (over two weeks in most cases), but now there is an upper limit on withdrawals at one time too. If you have an issue, be prepared to wait 14 days minimum for a response, which will be copy/pasted and ignore the issue before having your ticket closed.  </p>\n\n<p>This amount of bullshit from people who have your money in their hands just can&#39;t be accepted. eToro is dangerous for your money, and shows no signs of improving.
