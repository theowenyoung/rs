He then files a 13F, and buy&#39;s up 3.9 million shares...this would still put his profit average well over 1000%, AND would blow MM&#39;s attempts to pin the price out of the water, triggering a gamma squeeze...this creates massive margin calls by Tuesday 3/23, which coincidentally happens to be when GME reports earnings.  The convergence of these two factors in addition to hype momentum <strong><em>could be enough</em></strong> to then trigger the MOASS imo.
