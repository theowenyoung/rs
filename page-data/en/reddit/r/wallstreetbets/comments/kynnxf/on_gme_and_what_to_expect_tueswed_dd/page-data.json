There is now still an EVEN MORE obscene amount of shorts of GME (120-170% of float as high-quality estimates).</p>\n\n<p>2) There has been over a month of likely &quot;naked short selling.&quot; Aka, ILLEGAL market manipulation (Sells of unconfirmed shares that then end up not going through) in an attempt to further drive down price (27 days on NYSE Threshold securities list, since Dec 8th).</p>\n\n<p>3) Fees to borrow GME have gone up significantly (sitting around 30% atm) and required margins have increased at brokers (75% for Fidelity, 100% for Schwab). This means those brokers are less confident in it going down, and that there are less available shares floating around (lower volumes).</p>\n\n<p>4) Friday, there was a huge early shorting of the stock (the rapid 10% drop) that led to Rule 201 being invoked (stock can only be shorted on an uptick until EOD Tuesday). How do I know it was likely shorting? Because the drop stopped as soon as the Rule was invoked.</p>\n\n<h1>From these facts, what are conclusions I have drawn?</h1>\n\n<p>1) Investors (firms or otherwise) who have shorted GME are <strong>repeatedly doubling down</strong>. Big players are doing so to directly (and sometimes illegally, see naked short selling above) manipulate the market in a downward direction. <strong>They have been working on this for months, making the stock undervalued by far,  which is why short volume has been so high, and are continuing to manipulate this stock downward in an attempt to make those earlier shorts less of a failure.</strong></p>\n\n<p>2) They believe the current price increase will not be sustained or, more like IMHO, that they can out-short any increase that is sustained, so they are paying increasing fees on those shorts every day until the price drops enough (and it needs to drop A LOT for their earlier shorts).</p>\n\n<h1>So what do I think will happen Tues/Wed?</h1>\n\n<p><strong>1) On Tuesday, SEC Rule 201 is still in effect. That means that short sellers can only sell shorts on &quot;upticks&quot; (aka, they can only short at prices above the current market price). I expect that those short sellers will continue to double down, so we may see a price ceiling come into effect. Every time the price increases, the shorting can happen so they&#39;ll short it. I expect volume will be relatively low, and the price will not move very far.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2) On Wednesday, SEC Rule 201 is not in effect yet. If price moves significantly upwards on Tues, I would almost definitely expect an early short on Wednesday in an attempt to drive small profit selling and further drop the price. If price moves significantly downward on Tues, I would expect the same early shorting in an attempt to induce panic selling. Finally, if price doesn&#39;t move much on Tuesday, its much more of a toss-up on their strategy, but I would (personally) anticipate another attempt to short sell the price down as we saw Friday (deep pockets of shorters, already in very deep on shorts).</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: I think shorters gonna keep shorting (legally and illegally) so everyone should be prepared for that. They think the risks of losing older shorts outweighs the risks of additional shorting/the fees of new/old shorts. They&#39;ve done this level of consistent, repetitive shorting/market manipulation before and have only paid for it a handful of times.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just sharing my opinion of what happens next. I&#39;m not here to convince anyone to do anything.</p>\n\n<p>GME 266 at 36.54</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kynnxf/on_gme_and_what_to_expect_tueswed_dd/","title":"On GME and what to expect Tues/Wed (DD)","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-17T05:14:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-17 05:14","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kynnxf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kynnxf/on_gme_and_what_to_expect_tueswed_dd/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kynnxf/on_gme_and_what_to_expect_tueswed_dd/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Fair_Chart3403","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fair_Chart3403","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Fair_Chart3403","score":1251,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"周二/周三(DD)关于GME和预期的内容","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n我想用这个空间说说我对周二/周三GME的期望。\n(显然不是专家)。\n\n\n先说一些事实。\n\n1）上周GME涨停前有大量的短线股\n138%以上的浮动）。现在还有更猥琐的短线数量的\nGME...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"週二/週三(DD)關於GME和預期的內容","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n我想用這個空間說說我對週二/週三GME的期望。\n(顯然不是專家)。\n\n\n先說一些事實。\n\n1）上週GME漲停前有大量的短線股\n138%以上的浮動）。現在還有更猥瑣的短線數量的\nGME...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l8hsjd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8hsjd/billboard_in_oklahoma_city_ok_if_someone_can_rent/","title":"Billboard in Oklahoma City, OK!
