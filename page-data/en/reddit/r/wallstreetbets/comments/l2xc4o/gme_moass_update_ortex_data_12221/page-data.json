I&#39;m attaching an image from ORTEX after today&#39;s beautiful share price action. You bet that GME will be making news rounds all over the world after today, over the weekend. We&#39;re only getting started. If any of you have read my MOASS price target post from around a week or so ago**, you would know that I kept on hammering the term &#39;zero point&#39; over and over. It just means it&#39;s the starting point (whether it&#39;s your portfolio value, or the share price, or both) prior to a face-ripping MOASS. Well, if you&#39;ve held on to GME the entire time since that post, congratulations. Your zero point has just grown a substantial amount, <strong>especially</strong> after today&#39;s close @ +51.08% (as per Yahoo! Finance GME closing price). GME today even touched ~+-80% intra-day @ $76.76, breaking the previous Share Price ALL-TIME-HIGH of $63.77 (dated Dec. 7, 2008) from <strong><em>~13 years ago</em></strong> (data gathered using TD-ToS trading platform), <em>and then, closing at the new share price ALL-TIME-HIGH closing price @</em> $65.01 (as per Y! Finance GME). It&#39;s some fucking tendie-town shit.</p>\n\n<p>All the mathematical power and beauty of consecutive-day compounding interest is now to GME LONGS&#39; advantage. The inverse is true for shorts: they&#39;re getting seriously fucked by many things; face-ripping, ass-gaping, wife-fucking compounding interest only one among them. (Also, RIP to Citron Research AKA. Andrew &quot;Left for Dead&quot; Shitron.) Yeah, you read that shit right: SHORTS are about to get inflicted with MAXIMUM MATHEMATICAL PAIN. It sounds nerdy af I know, but ain&#39;t that the truth.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on GME short metrics &amp; data, and so I leave it to the experts to hopefully analyze what I&#39;m attaching here, hence a discussion thread. <em>AKA. WHAT DO THESE CRAYONS ON THE SCREEN MEAN, DADDY?</em></p>\n\n<p>However: based off off what I see on the data attached, I have come to believe that shorts have started to unwind their positions, albeit <strong><em>only slightly</em></strong>, relative to the entire short position. (I could be wrong, and if so, let me know in the comments. Let&#39;s discuss.) Still, as the data presents below, it seems that the SHARES SHORTED still stands at a HISTORIC &gt;100%, at 102.29%. <em>Goddamn. My asscheeks just clenched a little writing and thinking about all the trapped shorts (RIP). What an absolutely titanic and colossal failure of risk management.</em> Can&#39;t complain though lmao. <em>Tendies all day, everyday, bitch!</em></p>\n\n<p>Again remember, on WSB, we take into account TRADEABLE % of FLOAT, where, according to some DDs posted in the sub, is estimated to be running at around 200%+, due to (we, at the very least, assume) &#39;<em>fixed&#39;</em> massive institutional and insider ownership, that cannot/will not/<em>might not</em> sell, <em>all while</em> the shorts are fucking drowning and thrashing around, desperate to get some breathable air--in the middle of the goddamn <em>Atlantic Ocean</em> with no boats nor ships in sight. It&#39;s like <em>Titanic</em>, but they&#39;re Jack, and you&#39;re <em>the sexy-ass rich bitch</em> named Rose. Only one survives. <em>(Spoiler alert: It ain&#39;t Jack.)</em></p>\n\n<p>All said, I think we have a ways to go before all the shorts are fully covered (<em>we&#39;re talking potential MULTIPLES of current price, and, ergo, your DADDY-AS-FUCK GME PORTFOLIO)</em> e.g. more tendies to come. Focus, get ready, and have a plan. This could be <em>THE</em> trade of your lifetime.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xquiruns9yc61.jpg?width=7659&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d6d13ea9895a57c80ced0e43c6ebd00b702834c\">CRAYONS TO TENDIE-TOWN, BITCH. / You like that, daddy?

I&#39;m as curious as all of you about SI after today but want to make sure these numbers are right.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/fieryskyes\">u/fieryskyes</a>: <em>Hey man, good catch! Actually, the numbers CHANGED while posting this entire thing, RIGHT AFTER today&#39;s close. I literally had to re-type the data. The graph, I will agree, however shows Thursday 21st. Not sure what to make of that exactly. We will keep updating on this for sure. But from what I remember, the &quot;%FREEFLOAT ON LOAN&quot; data changed from 98.68% to 102.29% (as it stands now). Good comment. I will include this in the post itself.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yea, the &quot;%Free float on loan&quot; actually increased by ~3.5% while I was posting/writing this, as the CLOSING BELL struck (I use TD Ameritrade&#39;s Thinkorswim platform like a real trading daddy should, and it rings the bell at close 4PM EST SHARP. So ya I fucking remember that moment like a Pavlovian bitch.) It <em>could</em> mean that the ORTEX data reflected up-to-date data then. Fucking coincidence, amirite? Regardless, WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO before all short positions are covered, if they even have started to cover today in the first place. So chill, daddy, it&#39;s all under control and shit. Sit back, relax, and continue to jerk off to your KINGLY GME gains.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t worry my brothers, I will keep on watching ORTEX data, even on Monday. We will track this bitch in every possible way. <em>Shorts will not get out alive.</em> Also, you can get ORTEX data yourself, with a free 7-day trial period. Not affiliated with them in any way. Just consider it if you want the raw data for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2xc4o/gme_moass_update_ortex_data_12221/","title":"GME MOASS Update: ORTEX Data (1/22/21)","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-23T05:59:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-23 05:59","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l2xc4o","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2xc4o/gme_moass_update_ortex_data_12221/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2xc4o/gme_moass_update_ortex_data_12221/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/gC8UTBwEwVCas8A--JJ87n5b93byuPXTq5kfK__V0AE.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b17d31797c2233385467666fe83355e0d6403894","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"fieryskyes","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/fieryskyes","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"fieryskyes","score":2123,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME MOASS更新。ORTEX数据(1/22/21)","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我是你们友好的邻居，弱智的朋友，U/fieryskyes。\n[/u/fieryskyes]。\n\n想开一个关于今天GME短线数据的讨论主题。我是\n附上ORTEX今天漂亮的股价走势后的图片。您\n我敢打赌，GME将成为全世界的新闻... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME MOASS更新。ORTEX數據(1/22/21)","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我是你們友好的鄰居，弱智的朋友，U/fieryskyes。\n[/u/fieryskyes]。\n\n想開一個關於今天GME短線數據的討論主題。我是\n附上ORTEX今天漂亮的股價走勢後的圖片。您\n我敢打賭，GME將成爲全世界的新聞... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lbjgjw","excerpt":"(I am not a financial adviser.
