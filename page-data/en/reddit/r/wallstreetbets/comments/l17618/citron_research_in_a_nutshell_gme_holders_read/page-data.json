Well here’s a fairly precise not too technical guide as to who the fuck these roaches are, so that the average retard on <a href=\"/r/wsb\">r/wsb</a> with IQ in the -ve range can understand. Listen, english isn’t my first or my second language, i tried my best, suck it up if it ain’t good enough.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Citron Research</strong> is a shady as fuck stock commentary website operated by Mr. <strong>Andrew Left</strong>. Now a bit on this autist. In short, Andrew’s a 🌈🐻, in long he’s a self proclaimed “<em>activist short seller</em>”. He was married to Ms. Andrea Left, <em>her username checked out</em>. His internet newsletter has been running for 17 years now, and apparently has 50 cases in the company’s favor since 2001, do the math and you find out that he can fuckin time travel. Now, there’s a lot of stock commentary websites, newsletters, tv shows and podcasts. Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy?  </p>\n\n<p>Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy? Well, dear autists, the self proclaimed “<em>activist</em>” we’re talking about here, who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows : “He can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers.” His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial world’s scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p>Now, fellow autists, this part is very important. <strong>This is his strategy</strong>. Reported by NYTimes once again “After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company’s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries.” Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didn’t go his way. So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.html\">Source</a>. </p>\n\n<p>SERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT <strong>$177</strong>, ITS AT <strong>$4,325</strong> TODAY (Pre-Split price). If this wasn’t enough wait to hear the companies in his “<em>ambitious track record</em>”. </p>\n\n<p>Since all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots, let me do it for you fucking losers. What is he doing with GME. Are we not seeing the same pattern here? He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it. He is known for this kind of manipulation. When he noticed the price had crossed the $43 wall he made it public that he is short GME. He could’ve scheduled the meeting immediately, but no. He scheduled it a day later, now this is perfect for the 🌈🐻 because, he is literally buying time. Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on <a href=\"/r/wsb\">r/wsb</a>. <strong>24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE. BUT WHAT ARE WE GONA DO? WE ARE GOING TO FUCKING HOLD TO MARS</strong>🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. LATEST UPDATE received states that they chickened out of the livestream that was to be at 11:30AM EST. THEY NEED MORE TIME. THE SHORTS ARE SWEATING. THIS IS WORKING GUYS HOLD.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SCANDAL #1</strong>. Here’s a notable event on this aucstivist. In 2016, this 🌈🐻 was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing “false and/or misleading claims” about the above-mentioned company. Forced to pay a little over $720,000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses. He’s on his last string in HK, after his warning, he could end up in jail for violating once again. <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2038381/hong-kong-bans-short-seller-andrew-left-market-five-years\">Source</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SCANDAL 2</strong>. This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this. Jumia Technologies ($JMIA : NYSE) is an online e-commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012. They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019. It was received very well and rose from around $25 at opening to $41 within a matter of a few weeks. Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials. The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud, torpedo’ing the company downwards. It dropped till approx. $2.80. BUT GUESS WHAT, SURPRISE! SHITRON AND ANDICKREW 🌈🐻 said they’re LONG ON THE STOCK. AND THERE’S <strong>NO WAY</strong> THEY’RE SHORTING AGAIN. This man capitalized on the drop of an e-commerce startup out of Nigeria and is now currently benefitting from the uprise. $JMIA sits at $45.56 as of now. <a href=\"https://www.theafricareport.com/45712/jumia-short-seller-andrew-left-changes-his-mind-now-buying-the-shares/\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>Now these are just 2 scandals that I pointed out because no one on <a href=\"/r/wsb\">r/wsb</a> seems to be aware of this. Now i’m pretty sure if you’ve been active on the sub you’ve seen the COLOSSAL failures this company has made. I’ll attach it right here. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/QvKVC9V\">JUST GO AND SEE THIS ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A PROPER VIEW</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from this, another IMPORTANT info would be that, the live stream where he claimed he is going to expose the top 5 reasons why he’s GME short right now, would PROBABLY be live on his <strong>TWITTER</strong> (@CitronResearch). Hope to see everyone there and I CANNOT WAIT TO PROVE this self proclaimed <del>activist</del> WRONG.</p>\n\n<p>NOW RETARDS KEEP READING BECAUSE, this is not possible without everyone holding tight and buying more 👐👐👐👐💎💎💎💎💎💎. We will be hit badly again, the boomer investors cannot take Citron’s cock out of their mouths, so we expect a sell off, DO NOT GIVE THE BEARS A CHANCE TO BUY. Today could even be a red day, <strong>BUT FEAR NOT</strong>. We will hopefully emerge victorious. I AM SO PROUD OF EVERY LAST AUTIST ON HERE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong> :</p>\n\n<p>Holding our shares doesnt cost us anything 🤷🏻‍♂️.</p>\n\n<p>The short sellers pay high borrow fees and will eventually get margin called if the price rises further.</p>\n\n<p>A red day doesnt matter at all as we are not selling anyway 💎💎🙌🏼🙌🏼 its just a question of time until the next good news hit and it will explode 🔥🚀</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR : Citron’s been doing this for a long time. The stocks they short do go down only because boomer investors suck them off dry. Time for a revolution. HOLD ON TO YOUR STOCKS WITH DIAMOND HANDS 👐👐👐👐💎💎💎💎💎💎. HOARD AND HOLD. EVEN A RED DAY OR TWO WON’T EXTINGUISH THE FLAME IN WSB. LET US FUCKING TAKE OFF AUTISTS 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.</p>\n\n<p>Edit #1 : Citron really just chickened out of the livestream that was taking place lmfao. THIS IS WORKING EVERYONE HOLD 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l17618/citron_research_in_a_nutshell_gme_holders_read/","title":"Citron Research In A Nutshell. $GME holders read.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-20T20:23:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-20 20:23","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l17618","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l17618/citron_research_in_a_nutshell_gme_holders_read/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l17618/citron_research_in_a_nutshell_gme_holders_read/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/TBjG5rc79O0hgvlWaFh8gYj4tBkUfGnyEt8ZVQpp0OE.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=08da1161a6bfe91ed6ff17d93dd74c5d1f503d50","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"rohannx","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rohannx","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"rohannx","score":1789,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"香橼研究一言以蔽之。通用汽车E座阅读。","the_new_excerpt":"Citron Research到底是谁？好吧，这里有一个相当精确的... ...不是太技术性的...\n指南，谁他妈的这些蟑螂是，所以，一般的弱智在r/wsb的。\n[/r/wsb]智商在-ve的人都能理解。听着，英语不是我的母语\n或我的第二语言，我已经尽力了，吸它，如果它... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"香櫞研究一言以蔽之。通用汽車E座閱讀。","the_new_excerpt":"Citron Research到底是誰？好吧，這裏有一個相當精確的... ...不是太技術性的...\n指南，誰他媽的這些蟑螂是，所以，一般的弱智在r/wsb的。\n[/r/wsb]智商在-ve的人都能理解。聽着，英語不是我的母語\n或我的第二語言，我已經盡力了，吸它，如果它... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-la2861","excerpt":"..... and that becomes quite obvious when looking at the quality of recent\nposts.\n\nWhile it's great that Reddit is finally getting some worldwide media attention,\nall this is coming at a great cost.
