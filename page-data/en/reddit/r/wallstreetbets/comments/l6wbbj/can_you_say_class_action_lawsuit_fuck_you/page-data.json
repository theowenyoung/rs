This post was just out of frustration and memes over RHs bullshit corruption; I am not a laywer nor am I claiming that i&#39;m going to create a class action by creating this post. You retards do as you wish, feel free to join if you want. Hell, use it as a backup in case something happens to WSB, I don&#39;t give a fuck</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Stop giving me these beautiful awards you retards, use the money on GME. </p>\n\n<p>This is the way. 💎🙌💎. GME GANG FOREVER 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 STRAIGHT TO THE Nth DIMENSION BOYS 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I will be acquiring more shares today. I have 17.7k liquid money in my TD. Bought 15 shares @327. Waiting for another dip to yolo 12.7k into the rest. I have 18 shares holding on RH with average cost of $112. 1000EOD Boys. Fuck the shorts, fuck the establishment. Melvin and friends can suck my fat diamond encrusted cock. Don&#39;t forget to leave RH a nice review on the app store thanking them for your gains</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: I convinced my mother to yolo her stocks into GME early on @90. She still continues to add onto it and as of now she holds 147+ shares and is profiting well over 60k. I don&#39;t know what her cost average currently sits at but if my mother can 💎🙌💎 then so can you. She&#39;s more diamond-handed than me. Do your part brothers. We&#39;ll all be feasting on tendies from our golden plates and washing it down with Shitron tears as we wipe our asses with Melvin bucks by end of next week.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 4: I can&#39;t believe how much this is blowing up. I wasn&#39;t expecting it. But while I have the spotlight, I just wanted to thank every single one of you from the bottom of my heart. You tards have done absolute wonders for the community and started a financial revolution fueled by memes and autism.\n I read all these stories about how this community has helped people pay off their debts, care for sick loved ones, allowed people to give back to their local communities, and so much more. You guys are the true unsung heroes of this generation and are some of the most wholesome degenerates i&#39;ve ever seen. This fight isn&#39;t about just tendies anymore, its about justice and equality, it&#39;s about sticking it to the corporate elites who run the world. Don&#39;t let these greedy scumbags take what&#39;s rightfully yours, for too long the little guy has been pushed and shoved around but now it&#39;s our time to shine. Keep up the good fight and don&#39;t back down. 💎🙌💎 for days boys, WE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE SEE ELON SHOOT A GME THEMED ROCKET FILLED WITH THE BURNT ASHES OF THESE BASTARDS TO MARS. FUCK SHORTS. THIS ONE IS FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 GME 5,000 IS NOT A MEME NOW. POWER TO THE PLAYERS!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 5: Stop spamming me with awards and upvotes, you retards are crashing my inbox! Put forth all this glorious energy into GME.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: GME to 1,000 EOD, GME 5000 EONW. THE SUQEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZEN YET, BUY AND HOLD 💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6wbbj/can_you_say_class_action_lawsuit_fuck_you/","title":"Can you say \"CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT\".
