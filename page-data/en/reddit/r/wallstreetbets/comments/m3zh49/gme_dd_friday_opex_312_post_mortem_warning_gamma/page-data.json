You can amplify your share buying effect by buying calls at SPECIFIC STRIKES AND EXPIRIES. If you bought shares, it would take around 355 MM USD of net buy inflow to raise the price by 20% EOD, with ITM(safer)/ATM calls and the gamma amplification it would only take ~18 MM USD on the ITM/ATM calls 3/12 before 3/12 expiry.</p>\n\n<p>With the 3/12 now  expired, the amp factor and general cascading gamma effect will be lower, around ~ 40 MM USD net ITM(safer)/ATM calls needed.(that&#39;s about 40,000 🦍🦍🦍 each with 1k 🍌🍌🍌)</p>\n\n<h1>TL;DR 3/19 would be the last significant gamma squeeze opportunity based on current OI,🦍🦍🦍 together strong, YOLO-ers 🦍🦍🦍 buying 800C not helping.</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2 : From</strong> <a href=\"/u/JunkTheRat\">/u/JunkTheRat</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NEW TRADING RESTRICTIONS On GME:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page\">TD AMERITRADE - RESTRICTIONS ON GME</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Opening orders on short individual options are not allowed with the exception of cash-secured puts or covered calls, which must be placed through a broker.  </p>\n\n<p>If you currently own stock in one of these securities and wish to sell a covered call, you must do so with a broker.
