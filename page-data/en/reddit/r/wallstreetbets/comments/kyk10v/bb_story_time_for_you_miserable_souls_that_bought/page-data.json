Pure majestic autism. </p>\n\n<p>I come out of Plato’s cave to tell you I understand your pains. I was there not too long ago... you see... </p>\n\n<p>Back in November I noticed $BB cleanly up-trending on the hourly bouncing off the 9 and 26 MA (I use ichimoku) heading towards a resistance level that had already formed a double top </p>\n\n<p>Like a true Gamblers fallacy believing retard I made a wager: </p>\n\n<p>$10k into 3/19 6c’s on the DD that: “what are the chances it falls AGAIN there” ... that’s it. </p>\n\n<p>A few days later AWS news came, and that $10k turned into $70k. Pure luck. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn’t. She went that day.</p>\n\n<p>In that moment of seeing massive profits on AWS news day, I experienced violent and absolutely tremendous autism and thought, this thing is going from $5’s to $15 in a single trading session, yes, even more retarded than you guys that bought the top on Friday </p>\n\n<p>Sensible thoughts couldn’t penetrate my helmet fast enough as drool gushed from my gaping mouth, gasping for oxygen and yelling at the top of my lungs what barely resembled words about Lambo’s and Yachts... so I hurled about $100k into shares at $8.77 and about $10k more into $15 leaps </p>\n\n<p>I proceeded to watch my profit dwindle to nothing as earnings came and bent me over so hard I couldn’t bring myself to watch the stock for a week </p>\n\n<p>I thought about selling the bottom, I was there, order ready typed, just needed to hit the send button, and I was going to close my position around $6.7ish and be back to break even after striking gold </p>\n\n<p>But you know what, I remembered it’s just money. I remembered that everything in reality is in flux, and changing, and decaying, and being born again, and to just flow with it and stop clinging and desiring one set of experiences over another (aka a fat bank account over giving $5 blowies behind a Wendy’s) who cares? </p>\n\n<p>All is well lads. So let go of the burden if you bought the top and are stressing, it’s really fine. Look at what’s happening right now:</p>\n\n<p>1) Insane volume, insane moves, erratic behavior (something is going on behind the curtain) </p>\n\n<p>PS: this movement and volume is NOT because of WSB, full stop. Big players are making huge moves here, and fast, we don’t know why yet </p>\n\n<p>2) 1 Billion annual revenue </p>\n\n<p>3) Soon to come online a RECURRING AUTO DATA business that will drive revenue into growth cycle, BB is literally Microsoft Windows for cars but the auto sector was still underdeveloped technologically to benefit from this position, hence this vertical is finally about to print HUGE HUGE HUGE MEGA BILLIONS ANNUALLY. This was always the plan and they just had to wait it out until the auto sector caught up with them digitally </p>\n\n<p>(The auto data tech sector is so lucrative it made Papa Elon the richest person in the world, and forced a fucking god damn phone company to join the race 🍎—it’s huge)</p>\n\n<p>4) UNDER, FUCKING, VALUED </p>\n\n<p>5) VERTICALS GALORE</p>\n\n<p>5) FB settled, imagine the BALLS on BB going after this massive and dirty tech behemoth run by a literal lizard, they are honest Canadians doing God’s work </p>\n\n<p>6) IOT, AI, smart city’s, insert other buzzwords </p>\n\n<p>I could go on and on, and honestly, I’ve never felt more comfortable holding ANY stock than this </p>\n\n<p>Moral of the story: as I let go and accepted my circumstances and decided to diamond hand 💎 🤚 BB to the death, within a few days I proceeded to watch the fattest, thickest, randomest, greenest dildo penetrate my butt hole to the high heavens and take me from what was $70k profit to 0 profit back up to $130k profit. I’ve trimmed half the options, I don’t even know why tbh, reverse autism maybe, but I’m riding my remaining calls and entire share position to Valhalla. </p>\n\n<p>Will likely add more if it dips. But...</p>\n\n<p>Just hold. Something is cooking on BB. You have to be a retard not to see it. Look at the fucking daily chart, look at the volume, the gaps, the swings, BB chart literally has Tourette’s syndrome right now... </p>\n\n<p>This stock has not moved like this for 10 years. </p>\n\n<p>It might stall a little, deflate from here, consolidate a bit more, or it might blast off again any second. Point is, nobody knows when, but it looks like in a short time, we will know why this stock is moving the way it has. Something is DEFINITELY going on behind the scenes the public is not aware of and neither is the media </p>\n\n<p>For fucks sake I found the court docs showing global settlement with FB is done 24 hours before gay ass Bloomberg even picked it up. The majority of the investor world still thinks they make fucking phones for Gods sake. Everyone is sleeping on this </p>\n\n<p>A note on Jim just in case he reads this:</p>\n\n<p>Jim Cramer hates this stock because 1) BB and John Chen are not bootlicking CEO’s jerking off CNBC and massaging Cramers asshole for air time, they’re a tightly run, honorable company doing real things 2) He most likely became a bag holder during the epic fall of the BB phone and sold for a fat loss and wants to protect his ego by continuing to ignore the facts on the company</p>\n\n<p>The guy wants you to invest in CRWD with a fucking ridiculous market cap, no verticals, and less revenue than BB. Promoting a literal bubble over a value play. What a bizarre world we live in. Take advantage of it, I hear this phrase all the time and I fucking hate it, but this is literally “free money” </p>\n\n<p>Know what you own. There is TRUE value in this company. No hype. Pure value. </p>\n\n<p>Diamond hand, double down, buy more, and just hold. You are in good hands 🙌</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr diamond hand $BB</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyk10v/bb_story_time_for_you_miserable_souls_that_bought/","title":"$BB Story time for you miserable souls that bought the top... gather round my camp fire 🔥 lads, let me polish your 💎 🙌 until the mythical piercing green dildo will penetrate us so hard we get sent to the fucking moon 🚀 🌙","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-17T02:13:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-17 02:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kyk10v","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyk10v/bb_story_time_for_you_miserable_souls_that_bought/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyk10v/bb_story_time_for_you_miserable_souls_that_bought/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"fuk_normies","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/fuk_normies","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"fuk_normies","score":1370,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"巴恩斯B 为你们这些买了上衣的可怜人讲故事的时间到了... 围着我的篝火，伙计们，让我擦亮你们的💎 🙌 直到神秘的绿色阳具穿透我们的身体，让我们被送上他妈的月球 🚀 🌙","the_new_excerpt":"我删除了几个帖子，显示我的巴恩斯B的立场，因为我不希望任何人。\n现实中的我看到余额\n\n\"请尽快采取新的行动\"\n\n闭嘴Ret\n\n我可能很快就会删掉这个，但我知道你们有些自闭症的混蛋\n现在需要听到这个，是的，你，谁把市场订单 第一件事周五... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"巴恩斯B 爲你們這些買了上衣的可憐人講故事的時間到了... 圍着我的篝火，夥計們，讓我擦亮你們的💎 🙌 直到神祕的綠色陽具穿透我們的身體，讓我們被送上他媽的月球 🚀 🌙","the_new_excerpt":"我刪除了幾個帖子，顯示我的巴恩斯B的立場，因爲我不希望任何人。\n現實中的我看到餘額\n\n\"請儘快採取新的行動\"\n\n閉嘴Ret\n\n我可能很快就會刪掉這個，但我知道你們有些自閉症的混蛋\n現在需要聽到這個，是的，你，誰把市場訂單 第一件事週五... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l81iwp","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l81iwp/we_did_it_boys_we_saved_the_movie_theater/","title":"We did it boys - we saved the movie theater industry from COVID so we can enjoy premieres together when it ends! 🚀 Has anyone else also missed the theater experience?","date":"January 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我们做到了，孩子们--我们把电影院行业从COVID中拯救出来，所以当它结束时，我们可以一起享受首映礼! 🚀还有人也怀念影院的体验吗？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們做到了，孩子們--我們把電影院行業從COVID中拯救出來，所以當它結束時，我們可以一起享受首映禮! 🚀還有人也懷念影院的體驗嗎？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l8bw6c","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8bw6c/why_is_no_one_talking_about_mark_cubans_tweets/","title":"Why is no one talking about Mark Cuban’s tweets?
