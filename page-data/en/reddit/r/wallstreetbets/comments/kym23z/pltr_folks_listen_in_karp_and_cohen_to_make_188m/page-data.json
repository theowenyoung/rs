For those of you who don&#39;t know what this means:</p>\n\n<p>HSR filings are required (amongst a couple of other requirements) when someone is making an acquisition of &gt;$94m (this is the rate for the past year in 2020. will likely hike somewhere to ~$100m in 2021). This is what we saw with Mithril when they bought a fuck ton of shares in December (<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675\">https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675</a>)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Early termination requests are made to bypass the customary 30-day waiting period when someone makes an HSR filing.</strong> This implies that the individual wants to make a purchase in less than 30 days. Both of the early termination requests were granted. Karpy and Cohen are either buying leading up to demo day/the assumed (HOPEFULLY) price hike we see, or, maybe, right around lockup expy time.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d leave another thicc rocket for you fuckers, but mods keep auto-deleting the post because of the image.</p>\n\n<p>Current positions: 850 shares bought consistently from $10-$26 (average basis ~$22), and a fuck ton of calls for Nov &#39;21, Jan &#39;22</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kym23z/pltr_folks_listen_in_karp_and_cohen_to_make_188m/","title":"PLTR FOLKS LISTEN IN - KARP AND COHEN TO MAKE >$188M PURCHASE OF PLTR WITHIN THE NEXT 30 DAYS","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-17T05:14:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-17 05:14","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kym23z","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kym23z/pltr_folks_listen_in_karp_and_cohen_to_make_188m/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kym23z/pltr_folks_listen_in_karp_and_cohen_to_make_188m/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/uHSrFNbRGCcQXr57wpH361CCRd_sm-p1CeeM8FYh1Sw.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9636218d27067389998c9abbeb9fab845e1aff9f","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Minimum-Watercress-8","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Minimum-Watercress-8","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Minimum-Watercress-8","score":1309,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"PLTR的朋友们听好了--KARP和COHEN将在未来30天内购买超过1.88亿美元的PLTR。","the_new_excerpt":"快乐的星期六博伊斯。\n\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210753\n\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210752\n\n这两个男生做了HSR备案+申请提前解约（这...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"PLTR的朋友們聽好了--KARP和COHEN將在未來30天內購買超過1.88億美元的PLTR。","the_new_excerpt":"快樂的星期六博伊斯。\n\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210753\n\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210752\n\n這兩個男生做了HSR備案+申請提前解約（這...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-l8jwsl","excerpt":"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.
