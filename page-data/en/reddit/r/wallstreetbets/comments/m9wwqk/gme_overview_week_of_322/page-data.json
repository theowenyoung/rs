This is only a preliminary scan.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In order for the Option Chain to favor the HFs, they will want GME to get below 175 where more puts will be ITM than calls.</p>\n\n<p>The spread at 200 is more than double the spread at 195. If Hedge Funds can&#39;t get below 170, getting it below 200 is imperative for them as the spread begins to get out of hand.</p>\n\n<p>Total Calls and Puts ITM stays steady from 170 to 200, however that number begins to increase dramatically beyond 200. That difference is made up by a dramatic increase in Calls falling ITM. This means that a Gamma Squeeze may occur at around 250 and begin to compound if it reaches 300, 350, etc.</p>\n\n<p><em>Source: TastyWorks</em></p>\n\n<p>🚀 <strong>Shorts Available Overview (As of Close on Friday 3/19)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Actual GME Shorts Available - 10,000</p>\n\n<p>Effective GME Shorts Available through ETFs - 35,647</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://puu.sh/Hr7UQ/cafaad22b2.png\">\nETF Data Part 1\n</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://puu.sh/Hr7Vr/abd3aaf1dd.png\">ETF Data Part 2</a></p>\n\n<p>These are the numbers of shorts that HF&#39;s can borrow through interactive brokers that disclose their available shorts. This number does not represent the total number of shorts that HFs have that have not been placed in the market. This also does not represent shorts that can be borrowed from undisclosed locations.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at this data though, it seems that HFs are really low on ammo. The 2 million volume that we saw at the end of Friday might have been a good portion of their reserves. We will still continue to see attacks throughout the week, but it will be interesting to see how powerful those attacks are.</p>\n\n<p>Reminder that shorts need to be covered eventually.</p>\n\n<p><em>Source: iBorrowDesk (Shorts Available), ETF.com (% GME Allocation in ETFs)</em></p>\n\n<p>🚀 <strong>Closing</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the best data I have at the moment. I don&#39;t have access to a Bloomberg Terminal or any non-public information. I am not making any assumptions as to where GME will be by the end of the week. I am not telling anyone to make any sort of investment decisions. </p>\n\n<p>I am here to answer any questions and would be happy to discuss this data further.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>Ape Together Strong</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9wwqk/gme_overview_week_of_322/","title":"GME Overview - Week of 3/22","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-21T17:58:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-21 17:58","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m9wwqk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9wwqk/gme_overview_week_of_322/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9wwqk/gme_overview_week_of_322/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/ythRSw5UKKLidP4ph_8UJSt1ItQJeArnvXudpo-XfQM.png?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c903d143a4b0281f57a6231c57f1a44e4ed4fee1","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Corno4825","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Corno4825","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Corno4825","score":3927,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME概述--3/22周","the_new_excerpt":"🚀大家早上好!!!\n\n以下是本周GME的注意事项。祷告\n以免Automod再次对我进行核弹攻击。\n\n🚀 期权链概述 (截至 3/19 星期五收盘)\n\n行使价 认购价 ITM 认沽价 ITM 购买力(股数) 总C&P ITM % 认购价 % 赎回价 % 赎回价 % 赎回价 % 赎回价 % 赎回率\n跌停价差170 5,881... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME概述--3/22周","the_new_excerpt":"🚀大家早上好!!!\n\n以下是本週GME的注意事項。禱告\n以免Automod再次對我進行核彈攻擊。\n\n🚀 期權鏈概述 (截至 3/19 星期五收盤)\n\n行使價 認購價 ITM 認沽價 ITM 購買力(股數) 總C&P ITM % 認購價 % 贖回價 % 贖回價 % 贖回價 % 贖回價 % 贖回率\n跌停價差170 5,881... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1381947287442706434","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1381947287442706434","title":"Just had a digital bacon egg and cheese on brioche.","date":"April 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"デジタルベーコンエッグ＆チーズオンブリオッシュを食べました。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"刚刚吃了一个数字培根蛋和奶酪的布里奇。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"剛剛吃了一個數字培根蛋和奶酪的布里奇。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mqqrjf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqqrjf/ponzi_schemer_bernie_madoff_has_died_in_a_federal/","title":"Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff has died in a federal prison, believed to be from natural causes","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 14, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ネズミ講講釈師Bernie Madoff氏が連邦刑務所で死去、自然死とみられる","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"庞氏骗局策划者麦道夫死于联邦监狱，据信是自然死亡。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"龐氏騙局策劃者麥道夫死於聯邦監獄，據信是自然死亡。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m9wwqk","previousId":"TweetPost-1381947287442706434","nextId":"RedditPost-mqqrjf","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9wwqk/gme_overview_week_of_322/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
