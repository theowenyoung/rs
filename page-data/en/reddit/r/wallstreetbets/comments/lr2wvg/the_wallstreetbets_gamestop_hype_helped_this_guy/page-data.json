I want to thank everyone again who made this possible. I appreciate all the advice I got from everyone else who&#39;s dogs also went through the same surgical process and recovery. I got tons of tips that I think I&#39;ll find very useful.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of support I received from my last post (link below) was amazing. I never thought that everyone would have such a big heart. It has been a rough couple days with the surgery and since they had to keep him overnight it was very lonely time for both of us.</p>\n\n<p>He seems to be in good spirits even though he&#39;s a bit drugged up lol.  I bought a few more shares of GME and AMC.
