In the past we have been value holders of GME three other times and started a small position today nears it&#39;s intraday high and will likely add to this next week should the stock fall.   Previously all my Reddit comments have involved my e-Skate collection or my landing of my airplane in challenging conditions (see: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0\">https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0</a>) However, I can&#39;t resist commenting on the fascinating technical factors that likely will continue to propel this issue higher - perhaps significantly so over the next few weeks.  Andrew Left&#39;s mocking derision of retail investors may prove to be his waterloo.  Why would a value focused fund manager buy a stock that based on classic fundamental value analysis appears significantly overvalued?  </p>\n\n<p>GME appears to be a very interesting example of individual stock reflexivity.  What is reflexivity you ask?  This is the theory, originally promoted by George Soros that the stock market itself can cause the economy to either rise of fall (as opposed to the classic teaching that the economy affects the stock market).  An example of market reflexivity would be the great depression whereby a crashed market brought down an economy that was only in an ordinary recession, or the recent improvement in the economy, not withstanding Covid, which has followed a rising market.  In GME&#39;s case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.  Why?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>As the price of the stock rises, GME finds itself in the enviable position where it can use it&#39;s stock at currency to buy complementary businesses it could not otherwise afford - monetization of the current short squeeze by the enterprise will lead to fundamentally higher revenue and profits of the enterprise should they find good strategic acquisitions to further monetize their large retail customer base (which has real and to date largely untapped value).  The company is likely right now on the hunt for a major acquisition that could fundamentally alter the companies future prospects with that acquisition largely paid for on the back of short seller covering.</li>\n<li>Monetization of the short covering increase in share price via issue of a secondary .   The $500 million in debt (net of cash) the company currently has could be entirely extinguished with a secondary that is dilutive of only 10% of the equity base.  In fact such a secondary will, despite this dilution, likely result in a significant price rise for the stock (versus the usual fall in price after most, but not all, secondaries).  Bankruptcy risk will largely be eliminated with this secondary as will interest rate risk and financing costs ultimately increasing cash flow per share.  A 20% secondary will leave the company in a strong cash positive position with this cash available for expansion of sales efforts, cloud offerings, acquisitions, etc.</li>\n<li>Directly increased sales and revenue by virtue of the large amount of attention this epic short squeeze has brought to the company.  I suspect most long retail stockholders have explored the companies web offerings and are considering becoming customers.  This is free advertising to people with money who are tech savvy and the exact demographic GME would target with paid advertising.<br/></li>\n<li>Retention and efforts of existing management now becomes easy.  Every manager there wants to see this continue.  Operations at companies with sinking share prices typically suffer as management and employees leave the enterprise or develop anger and lassitude (think Sears Holdings).   The opposite is occurring here with every manager trying to beat their numbers to see the squeeze continue.</li>\n<li>This issue remains extremely heavily shorted.  Despite the squeeze that has already occurred, other &quot;value&quot; based investors have dived into short positions as the price has risen.  The short positions of this issue appears (although I can&#39;t be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well.  Although I don&#39;t yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time.  Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs.  We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the &quot;hard to borrow&quot; desk.  No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers.  This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue.  As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Impossible to know really where the stock goes from here as there does currently exist a disconnect from fundamentals. However, the extreme short position against the unrestricted common float here suggests to me there is a much greater chance of GME&#39;s price continuing to increase, perhaps significantly so, and this chance is far greater than the now fearful pundit in hiding&#39;s proclamation that the stock would soon see $20.</p>\n\n<p>For what it&#39;s worth, over the past 13 years of this funds life, we have significantly beaten both the overall market and the dow,  (12.2%/year margin over DJIA inclusive of dividends since 2008).  We  have had plenty of losing issues despite this beat but also way more big winners, some really big.  Right now my money&#39;s with the retail investors who are long GME.  We only have a small position here but this may prove a big winner for us also.
