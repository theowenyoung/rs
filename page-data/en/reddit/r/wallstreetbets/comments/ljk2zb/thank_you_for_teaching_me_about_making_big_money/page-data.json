Then with options back to 5k, and now to 50k this year due to cheapass tlry leaps and bcoin investments.  </p>\n\n<p>I was and I still am that same retard from day 1. I just got lucky, and I did learn some things about timing when to go in on option plays</p>\n\n<p>Anyways this post is about how I actually learned what a tax free savings account is, a retirement account is, and about different investments. Aka STONKs, Options, ETFs like ARKG, and yah fuck the rest of the low money shit like mutual funds and index funds. Who the fuck wants 2-10% a year of returns during this eurphoric bull run?</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to consider myself financially illerate. I didn&#39;t know shit about accounting, how to do taxes or how to build wealth. I started trading because I thought I could make some side money. I am also a lazy MF and had a okay job that paid 17/hr. But I was pretty much depressed. </p>\n\n<p>Now I consider myself a well informed retarded gambler. The stock market has literally changed my life for the better, and has completely changed my outlook on money and how the system is there to teach people to work, not to be wealthy. </p>\n\n<p>My fellow autist, you a smarter then most people who don&#39;t know jackshit about how much money you can make on the markets. Most people just give there money to the banks or just do passive investing(I have no issues with this, but missing out on great opportunities is super retarded). </p>\n\n<p>To everyone who wrote dds and gave advice, thank you. I don&#39;t care if it was bad, because I learned a fuck ton because you autist think differently. I am ready to share as much helpful info back!</p>\n\n<p>TLDR:</p>\n\n<p>Love you guys full homo and STONKS and options = 🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljk2zb/thank_you_for_teaching_me_about_making_big_money/","title":"Thank you for teaching me about making big money, wallstreetbets.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T16:49:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 16:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ljk2zb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljk2zb/thank_you_for_teaching_me_about_making_big_money/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljk2zb/thank_you_for_teaching_me_about_making_big_money/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"dp873","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/dp873","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"dp873","score":2474,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"谢谢你教我如何赚大钱，wallstreetbets。","the_new_excerpt":"到2020年开始，我开始用8k投资。拿到了10k。然后\n与选项回到5千，现在到50千今年由于廉价的屁股Tlry跃进和。\nbcoin投资。\n\n我从第一天开始就一直是那个弱智，现在也是。我只是运气好，我做到了\n学习一些关于时机的东西，什么时候去... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"謝謝你教我如何賺大錢，wallstreetbets。","the_new_excerpt":"到2020年開始，我開始用8k投資。拿到了10k。然後\n與選項回到5千，現在到50千今年由於廉價的屁股Tlry躍進和。\nbcoin投資。\n\n我從第一天開始就一直是那個弱智，現在也是。我只是運氣好，我做到了\n學習一些關於時機的東西，什麼時候去... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lupiet","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lupiet/this_is_the_way/","title":"This is the way","date":"March 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"是这样的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"是這樣的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lu9rys","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu9rys/335_10k_yes_i_sold_i_have_bills_to_pay_but_im/","title":"$335 —> $10k.
