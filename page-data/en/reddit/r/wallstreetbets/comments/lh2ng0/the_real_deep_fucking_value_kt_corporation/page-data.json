With that being said, I present you with the following:</p>\n\n<p>I’m a fan of DFV the man, but I’m more interested in really <strong>really</strong> deep fucking value.  This will likely be a long post, but I think you’ll find value in it if you can follow along (see what I did there?).  </p>\n\n<p>For those of you kids who can’t read good, I’ll put the <strong>TLDR</strong> right here at the top:  KT Corp ($KT) is so undervalued it’s almost fucking embarrassing.   When I say undervalued, I don’t mean by a little bit… I mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value.  At the time of my writing this, KT is trading at $10.62.  <strong>A realistic price target, if the market were to properly value this company, is ~$30.00</strong>  I’ll go in depth as to why as we continue through this story, but the long and short of it is the Tangible Book Value of KT Corporation is $19.66/share.  What does that mean?  It means if KT declared bankruptcy tomorrow, was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt, the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $19.66/share.  This does not take into consideration intangible assets – which have real value (in the $BILLIONS), but are harder to assess.  Again, it’s trading at $10.62 as of this writing (a price/tangible book value of only 0.54).  Value investors typically look for stocks trading at &lt;3.0 price/TBV.  Deep value would be &lt;1.0.  KT is trading at 0.54, and a price/book ratio of 0.42!  </p>\n\n<p>Shares are cheap, options are cheap.  Do what you will – hell, sell it short if you want – but I like shares and calls.</p>\n\n<p><strong>KT CORPORATE PROFILE</strong></p>\n\n<p>KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom) is a South Korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885 – but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form – with business operations sprinkled throughout Asia, Africa, USA &amp; Poland.  KT is South Korea’s first telecom company and dominates Korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete:</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Line of Business</strong></th>\n<th align=\"right\"><strong>% of Korean Market Share</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Mobile Services</td>\n<td align=\"right\">31.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Fixed-line local telephone &amp; VoIP</td>\n<td align=\"right\">64.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Broadband Internet Access</td>\n<td align=\"right\">40.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Pay TV Services</td>\n<td align=\"right\">31.6%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>As a conglomerate, KT has their hands in a number of diversified pots.</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><strong>Products &amp; Services</strong></th>\n<th align=\"right\"><strong>% of Total Revenue</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Mobile Services (incl. 5G)</td>\n<td align=\"right\">27.3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Fixed-line (incl.

KT has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program.  For what it’s worth in this day and age, the short % of shares outstanding is a measly 0.09%.  No one is going short on this thing at its current price.  You’d literally have to be insane to short it – it’d be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>FINANCIAL METRICS &amp; PEER COMPARISONS</strong></p>\n\n<p>KT’s balance sheet is rock solid.  While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis, it is still growing and maybe more importantly, doing so profitably.  I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above, but this cannot be understated.  If you were to liquidate the company entirely, shareholders would receive $20-30 per share after the debt had been repaid.  I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT.  </p>\n\n<p>Compared to US-based telecom services index peers:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/iOmE5mI.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/iOmE5mI.jpeg</a></p>\n\n<p>Using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $26.33 - $109.88 (unrealistic top end):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/0hYg7Zy.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/0hYg7Zy.jpeg</a></p>\n\n<p>Compared to industry peers/comps:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/lT8uPvh.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/lT8uPvh.jpeg</a></p>\n\n<p>The following comparison is really the tale of the tape.  When we look at tangible book value, we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value.  This is obvious, given the share price should exceed the liquidation value.  But we see the opposite being true for KT.  Again, <strong>it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value.</strong>  You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares, liquidate the company, and double your money.  This is what I mean by real <strong>deep fucking value.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/vGaVp9b.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/vGaVp9b.jpeg</a></p>\n\n<p>Not that we put much weight in them around here, but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well, with median upside of 33%. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Buhxpqq.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/Buhxpqq.jpeg</a></p>\n\n<p>They just published their updated earnings presentation and have positive forecasts for growth as well:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://corp.kt.com/eng/attach/record/2020/KT%20ER%20PT%204Q20%20ENG_FIN.pdf\">https://corp.kt.com/eng/attach/record/2020/KT%20ER%20PT%204Q20%20ENG_FIN.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>I am long shares and 07/16/21 $15 calls.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone looks for the <strong>TLDR</strong> at the bottom (I put it at the top of the post), but here it is:</p>\n\n<p>Massively undervalued, $30/share realistic price target, it&#39;s trading at half of its tangible book value - meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares, liquidate the company&#39;s tangible assets, pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets. This is REAL value.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh2ng0/the_real_deep_fucking_value_kt_corporation/","title":"The Real Deep Fucking Value – KT Corporation","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T15:25:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 15:25","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lh2ng0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh2ng0/the_real_deep_fucking_value_kt_corporation/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh2ng0/the_real_deep_fucking_value_kt_corporation/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/5eODGWhv7BmVhPzXJDTks6XI-1ZKaYPFnIneLrmc-Ao.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d8fc271e872337391c19e04424fc815c8933803d","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"clubba","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/clubba","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"clubba","score":2103,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"真正的深层价值 - KT公司","the_new_excerpt":"显然，我们现在都在说这个，但我不是理财顾问，而你呢？\n应该做自己的DD。说到这里，我向你介绍以下内容。\n\n我是DFV的粉丝，但我对真正的深层性交更有兴趣。\n价值。这很可能是一篇长文，但我想你会... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"真正的深層價值 - KT公司","the_new_excerpt":"顯然，我們現在都在說這個，但我不是理財顧問，而你呢？\n應該做自己的DD。說到這裏，我向你介紹以下內容。\n\n我是DFV的粉絲，但我對真正的深層性交更有興趣。\n價值。這很可能是一篇長文，但我想你會... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1365044246789709830","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1365044246789709830","title":"The markets are closed. \n \n✦ S&amp;P 500 ▼ 2.45%                   \n✦ Nasdaq ▼ 3.52%                   \n✦ Russell 2K ▼ 3.69%                   \n✦ Dow Jones ▼ 1.76% https://t.co/w9UW720td5","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"市场已经关闭。\n \nS&amp;P 500 ▼ 2.45% ．                  \n納斯達克 ▼ 3.52% ．                  \n罗素 2K ▼ 3.69% ．                  \n道琼斯 ▼ 1.76% https://t.co/w9UW720td5","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"市場已經關閉。\n \nS&amp;P 500 ▼ 2.45% ．                  \n納斯達克 ▼ 3.52% ．                  \n羅素 2K ▼ 3.69% ．                  \n道瓊斯 ▼ 1.76% https://t.co/w9UW720td5","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ls61ey","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls61ey/gme_yolo_update_20000_shares_and_still_holding/","title":"GME YOLO UPDATE: 20,000 SHARES AND STILL HOLDING! ✋💎🤚 Show me that 10K per share! 🚀🚀🚀🚀 I like cats.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 25, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"GME YOLO更新：20,000股，仍然持有! ✋💎🤚让我看看每股1万股! 🚀🚀🚀🚀我喜欢猫。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME YOLO更新：20,000股，仍然持有! ✋💎🤚讓我看看每股1萬股! 🚀🚀🚀🚀我喜歡貓。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lh2ng0","previousId":"TweetPost-1365044246789709830","nextId":"RedditPost-ls61ey","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh2ng0/the_real_deep_fucking_value_kt_corporation/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
