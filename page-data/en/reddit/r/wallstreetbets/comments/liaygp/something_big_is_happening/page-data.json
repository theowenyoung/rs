Recently I began reading WSB more, commenting, etc, because it helps numb the pain of my losses and adds some good laughs. My interest in investing in $ROPE has also decreased. I just realized that in my 7 years of &quot;investing&quot;, I have never actually realized a profit. If my account had green, I&#39;d always think let&#39;s enjoy some gains just for a day or two, and then it would tank as soon as I&#39;d want to cash out a bit. This isn&#39;t even a casino at this point, I am simply just making charitable donations which are then gambled by other retards. I have even managed to lose money in real estate in Vancouver, where pretty much everyone and their wifes boyfriend has made money. </p>\n\n<p>I came to the realization that this is all a game and it could not possibly be real. The game isn&#39;t rigged, its fake! This must be a simulation. As soon as I click buy, the stock tanks, if I invest in a property the market tanks, even when I pick fruits/veggies at the market they expire instantly, when I hop in the shower the water turns freezing cold. Anyone else feel like this???</p>\n\n<p>If 2 retards who are experiencing this did the opposite of eachother, would one of them make money? Or would this possibly end the simulation as both aren&#39;t actually allowed to make money?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Thanking you guys for the advice, I am staying away from the market until I learn more, even it takes years. Enjoy the soon to come record breaking market growth!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liaygp/something_big_is_happening/","title":"SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING!","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T18:18:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 18:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"liaygp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liaygp/something_big_is_happening/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liaygp/something_big_is_happening/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Karn235","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Karn235","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Karn235","score":3416,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"有大事发生了!","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，我已经在这里潜伏了一段时间了。最近我开始多看WSB。\n评论等，因为它有助于麻痹我失去的痛苦，并增加一些好的\n的笑声。我对投资$ROPE的兴趣也下降了。我才意识到\n在我7年的 \"投资 \"中，我从未真正... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有大事發生了!","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，我已經在這裏潛伏了一段時間了。最近我開始多看WSB。\n評論等，因爲它有助於麻痹我失去的痛苦，並增加一些好的\n的笑聲。我對投資$ROPE的興趣也下降了。我才意識到\n在我7年的 \"投資 \"中，我從未真正... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ltcdf5","excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/cuoi45a84xj61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=13d687f0ea48111e836d3a41bd6f3deb1c6d8ef4\n\nHello again my fellow apes🦍!\n\nBOILERPLATE: I still know nothing, I can't do math good.
