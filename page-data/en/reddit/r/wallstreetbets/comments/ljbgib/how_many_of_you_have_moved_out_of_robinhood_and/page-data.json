Their website and app seems very information dense and not as easy to use as Robinhood but I am willing to learn and am never going to get back to Robinhood. F**k Robinhood.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I was just curious if I was the only one moving out of Robinhood or are there other folks here doing the same. If you are moving out, what did you pick as an alternative to Robinhood, and why? I think your experience will probably help others decide where they want to move. Thanks.  </p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thank you so much for the replies. I hope replies help other people more than me. For those asking about what &quot;recent future&quot; means, sorry English isn&#39;t my first language. I meant to say &quot;near future&quot;, I guess. Also, for those of you accusing me of being associated with Robinhood and posting for them, here&#39;s the pic of my transfer status: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/fdfs1cg.jpg\">https://i.imgur.com/fdfs1cg.jpg</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljbgib/how_many_of_you_have_moved_out_of_robinhood_and/","title":"How many of you have moved out of Robinhood and how many of you plan to do so in recent future?","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T03:51:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 03:51","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ljbgib","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljbgib/how_many_of_you_have_moved_out_of_robinhood_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljbgib/how_many_of_you_have_moved_out_of_robinhood_and/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/3DqZS1a3dcUdR-GhwAFwXutzIV6JE3OUob9axgK5hMw.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6da251dc71c6a6b6ab2931775c2987fff5359de0","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"GodlessGreat","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GodlessGreat","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"GodlessGreat","score":2883,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你们中有多少人已经搬出了罗宾汉，又有多少人计划在近期搬出？","the_new_excerpt":"鉴于最近发生的事件，我做了研究，以寻找一个替代罗宾汉的方法。\n并最终启动了我的Robinhood账户的全部转移到Fidelity。\n他们的网站和应用程序似乎信息非常密集，而且不容易使用。\n罗宾汉的身份，但我愿意学习，而且永远也回不去了... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們中有多少人已經搬出了羅賓漢，又有多少人計劃在近期搬出？","the_new_excerpt":"鑑於最近發生的事件，我做了研究，以尋找一個替代羅賓漢的方法。\n並最終啓動了我的Robinhood賬戶的全部轉移到Fidelity。\n他們的網站和應用程序似乎信息非常密集，而且不容易使用。\n羅賓漢的身份，但我願意學習，而且永遠也回不去了... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-luh9ht","excerpt":"i now this must be a stupid and noob question but\n\n\n\nI am thinking about getting into some day trading and after researching a lot i\ngot a lot of warnings that 80% of people loose money day trading. but i am just\nthinking why dont people hold out on a stock until it eventually goes up.
