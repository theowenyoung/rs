But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.</p>\n\n<p>Without going into the science which won&#39;t mean much to most of us - it&#39;s a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.</p>\n\n<p>I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ir.bionanogenomics.com/?qmodStoryID=4789689684773596\">Dr. Gordana R. from Children&#39;s Hospital Los Angeles Presents Findings That Show Saphyr Detects Druggable Genetic Fusions in Pediatric Acute Leukemias  ...</a></p>\n\n<p>That story is from their <a href=\"https://ir.bionanogenomics.com\">investors website</a>. There are many others.</p>\n\n<p>Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4hecjqm6hbg61.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b0edb1352e0c7e254b4834bffa2a2c1b2d6b979\">If analysts raise PT to $15, market is probably gonna take it to $30</a></p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don&#39;t really care. People over at <a href=\"/r/BNGO\">r/BNGO</a> seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, here are my positions. It&#39;s not much, but I&#39;m working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you&#39;re interested: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">post</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wmys3wq3hbg61.png?width=2040&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=977836ef0dbb376d9592ec037ce6bae3b0598978\">\\&quot;Positions or Ban\\&quot;</a></p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can&#39;t suggest any long calls and I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there&#39;s risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not <a href=\"/r/investing\">r/investing</a> and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That&#39;s fine too. I&#39;ll just leave this here and people can decide if they want to buy in or not.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks and good luck to us all!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfluvn/bionano_genomics_why_you_should_care_about_it/","title":"BioNano Genomics - Why you should care about it","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T15:40:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 15:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lfluvn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfluvn/bionano_genomics_why_you_should_care_about_it/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfluvn/bionano_genomics_why_you_should_care_about_it/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"jackietsaah","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jackietsaah","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jackietsaah","score":1418,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"生物纳米基因组学--你为什么要关心它？","the_new_excerpt":"首先，我不是理财顾问，我喜欢某些股票，而非\n其他。\n\n我对投资BioNano Genomics持怀疑态度。\n[https://bionanogenomics.com/products/]在该股上涨后，该股的股价也随之上涨。\n价格在两个月内从0.5美元涨到10美元。但是，我产生了兴趣--我读到了，并且。\nI…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"生物納米基因組學--你爲什麼要關心它？","the_new_excerpt":"首先，我不是理財顧問，我喜歡某些股票，而非\n其他。\n\n我對投資BioNano Genomics持懷疑態度。\n[https://bionanogenomics.com/products/]在該股上漲後，該股的股價也隨之上漲。\n價格在兩個月內從0.5美元漲到10美元。但是，我產生了興趣--我讀到了，並且。\nI…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lqqvrx","excerpt":"You will regret it.
