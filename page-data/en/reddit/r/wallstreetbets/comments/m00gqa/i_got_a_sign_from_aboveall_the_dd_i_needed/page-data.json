I got into GME at 10 shares @ ~$300. On Friday Feb 5th, after market close, I decided I was just gonna call it a loss and close my position in GME the following Monday at market open. That Saturday, I drove 4 hours home and surprised my mom at my aunts house.</p>\n\n<p>My aunt put together a birthday dinner for my mom and I thought it would be a nice surprise for her to see her son on her b-day. It was a fun party. We ate, drank, and played games into the evening. At one point though, my aunt remembered something.</p>\n\n<p>She and her spouse moved her old ass couch out of her home to the dump the previous week. In the process of moving however, she found a wallet inside.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bpoihfh7fol61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d95e6300998685c2deac982bd32fa2107d0b664f\">https://preview.redd.it/bpoihfh7fol61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d95e6300998685c2deac982bd32fa2107d0b664f</a></p>\n\n<p>The wallet was my first wallet ever. It still had my 7th grade student ID card, locker combination, and class schedule inside. What really made my testies tingle though was the Gamestop Value card that was inside.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9wl2va36fol61.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16fe66b39e8491e7ac8cbe63976c5257158c487a\">https://preview.redd.it/9wl2va36fol61.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16fe66b39e8491e7ac8cbe63976c5257158c487a</a></p>\n\n<p>Of all the times over the last 15 years that this wallet could have been found, it remained hidden until the very time I needed it most. If this wasn&#39;t a sign from God or w/e you do or don&#39;t believe in, I don&#39;t know what is.</p>\n\n<p>After coming across this card my paperhands solidified into solid fucking diamonds. I watched the price like a hawk and bought the dip. I&#39;m in 20 shares at ~$190 now and I&#39;M NOT FUCKIN LEAVIN.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m00gqa/i_got_a_sign_from_aboveall_the_dd_i_needed/","title":"I got a sign from above....all the DD I needed.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-08T01:57:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-08 01:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m00gqa","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m00gqa/i_got_a_sign_from_aboveall_the_dd_i_needed/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m00gqa/i_got_a_sign_from_aboveall_the_dd_i_needed/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Sufficient-State-751","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sufficient-State-751","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Sufficient-State-751","score":10848,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我从上面得到了一个标志....，所有我需要的DD。","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，我的猿族同胞。\n\n我高价买进了GME。我在10股@约300美元的时候进了GME。上周五2月5日。\n收市后，我决定我只是要去调用它的损失，并关闭我的。\n下周一开市时，我持有GME的头寸。那个星期六，我开了4\n小时的家和惊喜我的妈妈在我的阿姨... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我從上面得到了一個標誌....，所有我需要的DD。","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，我的猿族同胞。\n\n我高價買進了GME。我在10股@約300美元的時候進了GME。上週五2月5日。\n收市後，我決定我只是要去調用它的損失，並關閉我的。\n下週一開市時，我持有GME的頭寸。那個星期六，我開了4\n小時的家和驚喜我的媽媽在我的阿姨... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mc62l6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc62l6/cramer_actually_made_perfect_sense_for_once_lol/","title":"Cramer actually made perfect sense for once lol","date":"March 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Cramer这一次居然说得很有道理，呵呵","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Cramer這一次居然說得很有道理，呵呵","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mc41hw","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc41hw/axios_reporting_on_50_of_americans_saying_markets/","title":"Axios reporting on 50% of Americans saying markets are rigged.
