However, MVIS (large position at 11 (gain)), CLOV (large position at 15 (loss)), BB, SPY PUTS (Margin Called More times than I like to admit), etc are just squeeze or yolo plays.</p>\n\n<p>MNMD is something else, it not only presents possible endless tendies but fuck we could be looking at the new generation of treatment for depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, and many other mental health disorders. I had people in my life that I wish had the opportunity to experience this type of treatment. A treatment outside of conventional pharma or therapy, both of which I am a huge advocate for (please always seek help), but sometimes there is a different means. Something that could have helped the person who everyone said they &quot;tried everything&quot; for. I&#39;m sick of hearing we tried everything when there is more. I hope we can continue to progress and alter our perception of how to treat the many different things that so many struggle with every day.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the only thing this company produces is one new treatment at least it adds one more thing to the &quot;tried everything&quot; process, because it&#39;s one more thing that could have maybe helped him.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n05l76/mnmd_one_of_a_kind_research_i_wish_was_funded_5/","title":"MNMD One Of A Kind Research I Wish Was Funded 5 Years Ago","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"April 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-28T15:22:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-28 15:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n05l76","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n05l76/mnmd_one_of_a_kind_research_i_wish_was_funded_5/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n05l76/mnmd_one_of_a_kind_research_i_wish_was_funded_5/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"BogDust","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BogDust","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"BogDust","score":1384,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"MNMD One Of A Kind Research 5年前に資金提供して欲しかった研究","the_new_excerpt":"ここで、心の医学に関心が集まっているのを見て、私は猿の心を温めました。\n医療は私の猿の心を温めてくれます。私たち愚か者は皆、できるだけ多くのお金を稼ぎたい（または失いたい）と思っています。\n儲けようとしていますが、これは残念ながら、あまりにも身近すぎます。\n私が望む以上に心に響くものがあります。\n\n私はGMEが大好きで、AMCも所有しています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我希望五年前就能得到资助的MNMD一类的研究","the_new_excerpt":"我只想说，看到这里有很多人对心灵医学感兴趣，这让我的心很温暖。\n医学，这让我的猿心感到温暖。我知道我们所有的弱智都想赚（或赔）尽可能多的钱。\n尽可能多的钱，但不幸的是，这一次有点太接近\n但不幸的是，这个问题比我想的更接近内心。\n\n我爱GME，和AMC，我将拥有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我希望五年前就能得到資助的MNMD一類的研究","the_new_excerpt":"我只想說，看到這裏有很多人對心靈醫學感興趣，這讓我的心很溫暖。\n醫學，這讓我的猿心感到溫暖。我知道我們所有的弱智都想賺（或賠）儘可能多的錢。\n儘可能多的錢，但不幸的是，這一次有點太接近\n但不幸的是，這個問題比我想的更接近內心。\n\n我愛GME，和AMC，我將擁有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n0dsxv","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0dsxv/mvis_microvision_announces_completion_of_its/","title":"MVIS | MicroVision Announces Completion of its Long-Range Lidar Sensor A-Sample Hardware and Development Platform","date":"April 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"MVIS｜マイクロビジョン、長距離ライダーセンサーAサンプルのハードウェアと開発プラットフォームを完成","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"MVIS--MicroVision宣布完成其长距离激光雷达传感器A-样品硬件和开发平台的开发工作","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"MVIS--MicroVision宣佈完成其長距離激光雷達傳感器A-樣品硬件和開發平臺的開發工作","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1387375890607263748","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1387375890607263748","title":"https://t.co/NrdE4oTACd","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 28, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"https://t.co/NrdE4oTACd","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"https://t.co/NrdE4oTACd","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"https://t.co/NrdE4oTACd","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-n05l76","previousId":"RedditPost-n0dsxv","nextId":"TweetPost-1387375890607263748","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n05l76/mnmd_one_of_a_kind_research_i_wish_was_funded_5/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
