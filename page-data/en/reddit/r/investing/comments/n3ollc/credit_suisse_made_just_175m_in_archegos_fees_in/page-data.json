The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year</strong>. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.</p>\n\n<p>The bank’s management is particularly <strong>alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business</strong>, the people said.</p>\n\n<p>Credit Suisse also demanded a <strong>margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions</strong>, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.</p>\n\n<p>Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.</p>\n\n<p>On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.</p>\n\n<p>“Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”</p>\n\n<p>Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.</p>\n\n<p>Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.</p>\n\n<p>Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.</p>\n\n<p>Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.</p>\n\n<p>While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.</p>\n\n<p>The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.</p>\n\n<p>Credit Suisse declined to comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/n3ollc/credit_suisse_made_just_175m_in_archegos_fees_in/","title":"Credit Suisse made just $17.5m in Archegos fees in year before $5.4bn losses","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"May 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-03T06:35:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-03 06:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n3ollc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n3ollc/credit_suisse_made_just_175m_in_archegos_fees_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n3ollc/credit_suisse_made_just_175m_in_archegos_fees_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Important-Ad6786","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Important-Ad6786","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Important-Ad6786","score":1432,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"クレディ・スイス社、54億ドルの損失の前の年にアルケゴス社から得た手数料はわずか1750万ドル","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.ft.com/content/429f2cd2-db55-42b8-a65c-a228cdb3089d\n\n> クレディ・スイスは昨年、アルケゴスからわずか1,600万スイスフラン（1,750万ドル）の収入しか得ていませんでした。\n> 3月に突然破綻し、スイス銀行に54億ドルの損失を与えたファミリー・オフィスである\n> 昨年3月の突然の破綻により、スイスの銀行が54億ドルの損失を被ったファミリー・オフィス、アルケゴス・キャピタルからの収益はわずか1600万スイスフラン（1750万ドル）だった。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"瑞士信贷在损失54亿美元之前的一年中仅赚取了1750万美元的Archegos费用","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.ft.com/content/429f2cd2-db55-42b8-a65c-a228cdb3089d\n\n> 瑞士信贷去年从Archegos获得的收入仅为1600万瑞士法郎（1750万美元）。\n> 财富，该家族办公室在3月突然倒闭，给瑞士银行造成了54亿美元的损失。\n据知情人士透露，该家族办公室在3月份突然倒闭，给瑞士>银行造成了54亿美元的损失。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"瑞士信貸在損失54億美元之前的一年中僅賺取了1750萬美元的Archegos費用","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.ft.com/content/429f2cd2-db55-42b8-a65c-a228cdb3089d\n\n> 瑞士信貸去年從Archegos獲得的收入僅爲1600萬瑞士法郎（1750萬美元）。\n> 財富，該家族辦公室在3月突然倒閉，給瑞士銀行造成了54億美元的損失。\n據知情人士透露，該家族辦公室在3月份突然倒閉，給瑞士>銀行造成了54億美元的損失。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n3c8mo","excerpt":"CLOV might be the greatest play in the history of investments.
