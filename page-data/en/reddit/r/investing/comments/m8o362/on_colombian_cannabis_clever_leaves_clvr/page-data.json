With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”</p>\n\n<p>Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia , the capital of drugs. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:</p>\n\n<p>- Sunlight 12 hours a day</p>\n\n<p>- Sunlight year around</p>\n\n<p>- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) </p>\n\n<p>- High Elevation helps with pest control.</p>\n\n<p>- Colombia already dominates flower exports.</p>\n\n<p>But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.</p>\n\n<p>Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .</p>\n\n<p>Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.</p>\n\n<p>“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”</p>\n\n<p>Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.</p>\n\n<p>Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.</p>\n\n<p>Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Company</th>\n<th>Market Cap ($)</th>\n<th>Cost per Gram ($)</th>\n<th>Cultivation Capacity (sq ft)</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Clever Leaves</td>\n<td>341.077M</td>\n<td>0.20</td>\n<td>1.9M</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aphria</td>\n<td>6.16B</td>\n<td>1.04</td>\n<td>2.45M</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tilray</td>\n<td>4.39B</td>\n<td>2.36</td>\n<td>1.1M</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aurora</td>\n<td>2B</td>\n<td>1.49</td>\n<td>1.5M</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Canopy Growth</td>\n<td>13.18B</td>\n<td>Did not find</td>\n<td>7,665,890</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sundial Growers</td>\n<td>2.42B</td>\n<td>1.86</td>\n<td>0.448M</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>The earnings are coming up march 30 2021. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/02/2185256/0/en/Clever-Leaves-Receives-Largest-2021-Production-Quotas-from-the-Colombian-Government.html#:%5C%7E:text=Clever%20Leaves%20was%20granted%20EU,select%20few%20in%20the%20world\">https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/02/2185256/0/en/Clever-Leaves-Receives-Largest-2021-Production-Quotas-from-the-Colombian-Government.html#:\\~:text=Clever%20Leaves%20was%20granted%20EU,select%20few%20in%20the%20world</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/17/2194641/0/en/Clever-Leaves-and-Ethypharm-Announce-German-Pharmaceutical-Cannabis-Partnership.html\">https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/17/2194641/0/en/Clever-Leaves-and-Ethypharm-Announce-German-Pharmaceutical-Cannabis-Partnership.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mjbizdaily.com/deal-between-clever-leaves-canopy-could-be-template-for-other-cannabis-firms/\">https://mjbizdaily.com/deal-between-clever-leaves-canopy-could-be-template-for-other-cannabis-firms/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_e869268023cc6eaabea30d10a4e17201/cleverleaves/db/858/7512/pdf/CLVR+Investor+Presentation+-+Jan+2021+v3+-+FINAL.pdf\">https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_e869268023cc6eaabea30d10a4e17201/cleverleaves/db/858/7512/pdf/CLVR+Investor+Presentation+-+Jan+2021+v3+-+FINAL.pdf</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m8o362/on_colombian_cannabis_clever_leaves_clvr/","title":"On Colombian Cannabis ( Clever Leaves $CLVR )","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-19T21:50:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-19 21:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m8o362","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m8o362/on_colombian_cannabis_clever_leaves_clvr/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m8o362/on_colombian_cannabis_clever_leaves_clvr/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"RandomPersonTravels","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomPersonTravels","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"RandomPersonTravels","score":370,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"关于哥伦比亚大麻 ( Clever Leaves $CLVR )","the_new_excerpt":"\"Clever Leaves是一家跨国大麻公司，重点在于\n生态可持续、规模化种植和医药级的 \"三生三世\"。\n大麻加工是其全球大麻业务的基石。随着业务\n并在美国、加拿大、哥伦比亚、德国和投资。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於哥倫比亞大麻 ( Clever Leaves $CLVR )","the_new_excerpt":"\"Clever Leaves是一家跨國大麻公司，重點在於\n生態可持續、規模化種植和醫藥級的 \"三生三世\"。\n大麻加工是其全球大麻業務的基石。隨着業務\n並在美國、加拿大、哥倫比亞、德國和投資。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mpi8mt","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mpi8mt/inconceivable/","title":"Inconceivable!","date":"April 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"信じられない!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"难以想象！","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"難以想象！","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-mpabnh","excerpt":"These daily discussions run from Monday to Friday including during our themed\nposts.\n\nSome helpful links:\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd] for charts, fundamentals, and\n   aggregated news on individual stocks\n * Bloomberg market news [https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n   *…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mpabnh/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_apr_12_2021/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Monday -
