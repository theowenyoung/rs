I would like to use options to profit off of that, but I don&#39;t want to short because I&#39;m not comfortable with unlimited downside in case I&#39;m wrong.  I also do NOT own any ABC stock.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is I can do the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Buy a &quot;put option&quot; as &quot;buy to open&quot;. This gives me the right, but not the obligation, to sell ABC stock at the strike price by the given date. For this privilege, I pay a premium upfront. </li>\n<li>I would not want to &quot;buy to close&quot; as this would be &quot;shorting&quot; and leave me on the hook to cover the position (though without paying a premium).</li>\n<li>Since I don&#39;t have stock in ABC I could <em>not</em> exercise the contract even if it were &quot;in the money&quot; (profitable), but I CAN sell it to someone who has stock in ABC who would want to exercise to offset their losses. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Are the above all fully correct? I really don&#39;t want to accidentally buy the wrong thing and be on the hook.</li>\n<li>If that&#39;s all right, how does part 3 work? I don&#39;t see in my Ameritrade window a place to buy and sell existing options on an options market. It seems like the options tab exclusively deals with creating new contracts (options) not buying or selling someone elses.
