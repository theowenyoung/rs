Part 2 includes my quantitative thoughts. Almost all of the data I provide here comes from the company’s <a href=\"https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373?cik=1679788\">S-1 filing</a>, website, <a href=\"https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788\">latest Q1 2021 report</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/coinbase-ipo-s-1-breakdown#:%7E:text=Coinbase%2C%20the%20leading%20digital%20currency,their%20S%2D1%20last%20week.&amp;text=The%20company%20is%20riding%20a,for%20when%20they%20start%20trading\">Meritech’s breakdown of Coinbase’s S-1.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Overview of Q1 2021 Results</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I’ve spread Coinbase’s key financial results and metrics over the past 9 quarters <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzNvBZZVoAgWzDW?format=png&amp;name=large\">here</a> and all you really need to do is look at the last column to see the insane growth Coinbase has experienced in the past quarter</li>\n<li>To highlight a few of the most impressive stats from Q1 2021 alone:\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$1.8BN in revenue</strong> - 208% growth vs. Q4 2020 and almost equivalent to all of 2019-2020 revenue <strong>combined</strong></li>\n<li><strong>$1.1BN in EBITDA</strong> (63% EBITDA margin) and <strong>$765M in net income</strong> (43% net income margin) - highly profitable business</li>\n<li>$223BN assets held on Coinbase / $1.9TN crypto market cap = <strong>11% market share (share has been growing from 5% in 2019</strong></li>\n<li><strong>56 million verified users -</strong> 148% increase vs. Q4 2020</li>\n<li><strong>6.1 million monthly transacting users</strong> - 118% increase vs. Q4 2020</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>In short, Coinbase couldn’t have picked a better time to go public given its business is firing on all cylinders</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&amp;table=35\"><strong>S-1 Income statement Overview</strong></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Already went through revenue, EBITDA, and net income above so won’t go into those numbers in this section and instead here are some interesting details about how Coinbase operates:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only 5% of total revenue comes from <strong>institutional trading</strong> vs. 90% from <strong>retail</strong> (<a href=\"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg\">source</a>)\n\n<ul>\n<li>As you can see from this <a href=\"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc425026023788b31aa90_Retail%20vs%20Inst%20Trading%20Volume.jpg\">chart</a>, institutional trading which is in orange is increasingly taking up a larger portion of trading activity, but since the fees are much less, institutions aren’t as big of a revenue driver for the company</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>As an investor, you also want to pay attention to Coinbase’s <a href=\"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg\">subscription and services revenue</a> which is <strong>growing quickly but only represents 4% of revenue</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>These revenue streams are important because they aren’t as reliant on the volatile crypto market</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Another key component of revenue you’ll want to keep track of is <strong>Coinbase’s fees</strong> which is known to be one of the highest amongst all crypto exchanges. There is a <a href=\"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg\">slight downward trend</a> which may continue over time as competition intensifies</li>\n<li>Something I personally find most impressive is that only <strong>4% of revenue was spent on sales &amp; marketing</strong>. The company states that <a href=\"https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&amp;hl=450165:450601&amp;hl_id=vkh5d_8u5\">90% of its retail users came through word of mouth</a> which just means customers are freely marketing for the company</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>So in sum, Coinbase’s income statement looks really great but it’s important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly <a href=\"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg\">if you look at the quarterly figures</a>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase’s revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very strong correlation between these two metrics</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at <a href=\"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg\">this visual</a>. The blue bars here represent Coinbase’s operating income while the orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all over the place</li>\n<li><strong>Main takeaway:</strong> Coinbase’s reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&amp;table=38\"><strong>S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview</strong></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Coinbase’s 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with <strong>a little less than $3BN in free cash flow</strong> which sounds pretty outstanding (but there’s a catch):\n\n<ul>\n<li>Custodial funds are basically <strong>cash deposits customers are holding</strong> on Coinbase’s platforms and the company is <strong>restricted</strong> form using this cash</li>\n<li>This means that custodial funds actually <strong>inflate</strong> Coinbase’s cash from operations since it’s not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers</li>\n<li>As a result, Coinbase’s cash from operations for 2020 is closer to <strong>$300 million</strong> and their free cash flow is closer to <strong>$285 million</strong> which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures</li>\n<li>Definitions in case it’s helpful: \n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cash from operations</strong> represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Free cash flow</strong> is the cash the company generates that they are “free” to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&amp;table=34\"><strong>S-1 Balance Sheet Overview</strong></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>With <strong>$1BN in cash and no debt,</strong> Coinbase is in a very solid position\n\n<ul>\n<li>Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that’s also balanced on the liability section</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the <strong>crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings</strong> which are interrelated and offset one another</li>\n<li>The last thing I want to mention is that <strong>Coinbase’s PP&amp;E is only $50 million</strong> which is tiny compared to the company’s scale\n\n<ul>\n<li>Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&amp;E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Coinbase Valuation</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company’s results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I’ll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations</li>\n<li>With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = <strong>$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,</strong> which represents <strong>464% year over year growth</strong> vs. 2020</li>\n<li>Comparing against some of the <a href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png\">fastest growing software companies in the world</a>, no company comes close to Coinbase’s revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase’s revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year</li>\n<li>As a result, I think it’s fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company’s volatility and potential downside\n\n<ul>\n<li>9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = <strong>$250 / share</strong></li>\n<li>11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = <strong>$313 / share</strong></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase</strong> with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What I’m Doing</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I’d be comfortable buying Coinbase at <strong>$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (~5% max)</strong> as I think that it&#39;s a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been\n\n<ul>\n<li>I know there’s a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don’t see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can’t buy crypto in</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just <strong>pure personal speculation</strong>), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company&#39;s volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn&#39;t blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I&#39;m bullish on crypto in the long-run, I&#39;m cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mu1z70/coinbase_deep_dive_diligence_part_2_of_2/","title":"Coinbase Deep Dive Diligence - Part 2 of 2 (Quantitative Thoughts)","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"April 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-20T01:15:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-20 01:15","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mu1z70","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mu1z70/coinbase_deep_dive_diligence_part_2_of_2/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mu1z70/coinbase_deep_dive_diligence_part_2_of_2/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"rareliquid","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rareliquid","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"rareliquid","score":166,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"Coinbase Deep Dive Diligence - Part 2 of 2 (Quantitative Thoughts)","the_new_excerpt":"以下は、Coinbaseに関する私のディリジェンスの2つのうちのパート2です。パート1\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mr2m8u/coinbase_deep_dive_diligence_part_1_of_2/]をご覧ください。\nには、定性的な考えが含まれています。パート2では、私の定量的な考えを述べています。 ほとんど\nここで提供するデータのほとんどは、会社のS-1...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Coinbase深耕细作--第2部分（量化思路）。","the_new_excerpt":"以下是我对Coinbase的勤奋的第2部分。第一部分\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mr2m8u/coinbase_deep_dive_diligence_part_1_of_2/]\n包括定性的想法。第二部分包括我的定量思考。 几乎\n我这里提供的所有数据都来自公司的S-1... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Coinbase深耕細作--第2部分（量化思路）。","the_new_excerpt":"以下是我對Coinbase的勤奮的第2部分。第一部分\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mr2m8u/coinbase_deep_dive_diligence_part_1_of_2/]\n包括定性的想法。第二部分包括我的定量思考。 幾乎\n我這裏提供的所有數據都來自公司的S-1... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mudsdi","excerpt":"Empower Clinics - U.S OTC: EPWCF - CSE: CBDT Current SP as of 4/19: 0.50\n\nA fully integrated healthcare & wellness company with brick and mortar clinics,\na medical testing laboratory / R&D company Kai Medical located in Dallas, TX and\ndirect to consumer COVID-19 Saliva PCR Test Kits\n\n-Quick Bullet…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mudsdi/empower_clinics_dd_an_integrated_healthcare/","title":"Empower Clinics DD - An Integrated Healthcare & Wellness Company","date":"April 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"エンパワークリニックDD - 総合ヘルスケア＆ウェルネス企業","the_new_excerpt":"Empower Clinics - U.S. OTC: EPWCF - CSE: CBDT 4/19現在のSP: 0.50\n\n実店舗のクリニックを持つ、総合的なヘルスケア＆ウェルネス企業です。\n米国テキサス州ダラスにある医療検査室／研究開発会社Kai Medicalと、直接消費者に販売するCOVID-19 SALVIDを有する。\nCOVID-19唾液PCR検査キットを販売しています。\n\n-Quick Bullet...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Empower Clinics DD--一家综合性的保健和健康公司。","the_new_excerpt":"Empower Clinics - 美国场外交易代码：EPWCF - CSE：CBDT 当前SP截至4/19：0.50\n\n一家拥有实体诊所的全面整合的医疗保健和健康公司。\n医学测试实验室/研发公司Kai Medical位于德克萨斯州达拉斯市，是一家集研发、生产、销售为一体的公司。\n直接面向消费者的COVID-19唾液PCR检测试剂盒。\n\n-快速子弹...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Empower Clinics DD--一家綜合性的保健和健康公司。","the_new_excerpt":"Empower Clinics - 美國場外交易代碼：EPWCF - CSE：CBDT 當前SP截至4/19：0.50\n\n一家擁有實體診所的全面整合的醫療保健和健康公司。\n醫學測試實驗室/研發公司Kai Medical位於德克薩斯州達拉斯市，是一家集研發、生產、銷售爲一體的公司。\n直接面向消費者的COVID-19唾液PCR檢測試劑盒。\n\n-快速子彈...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1383882818590154759","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1383882818590154759","title":"Big week coming up for financial markets.\n\nEarnings: Netflix, Chipotle, J&amp;J\n\nEcon: New home sales, existing home sales\n\nIPO: Four Seasons Total Landscaping","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 20, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"今週は金融市場にとって重要な週となります。\n\n収益です。Netflix、Chipotle、J&amp;J\n\nEcon: 新築住宅販売件数、中古住宅販売件数\n\nIPO フォーシーズンズ・トータル・ランドスケーピング","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"金融市场即将迎来大周。\n\n财报。Netflix，Chipotle，J&amp;J。\n\n经济：新屋销售、现房销售、J&amp;J 新房销售，现房销售\n\nIPO。四季沐歌","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"金融市場即將迎來大周。\n\n財報。Netflix，Chipotle，J&amp;J。\n\n經濟：新屋銷售、現房銷售、J&amp;J 新房銷售，現房銷售\n\nIPO。四季沐歌","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-mu1z70","previousId":"RedditPost-mudsdi","nextId":"TweetPost-1383882818590154759","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mu1z70/coinbase_deep_dive_diligence_part_2_of_2/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
