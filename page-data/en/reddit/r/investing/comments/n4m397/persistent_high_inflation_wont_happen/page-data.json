This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they <em>want</em> asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn&#39;t want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.</p>\n\n<p>The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan&#39;s lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.</p>\n\n<p>Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That&#39;s how long it&#39;s been since we had an inflation problem!</p>\n\n<p>The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They&#39;ve learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.</p>\n\n<p>ELI5: Basically all the stocks that have crashed because the companies don&#39;t generate free cash flow will go up again.
