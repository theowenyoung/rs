Berkshire bought stock in Verizon Communications Inc., insurance broker Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. and Chevron Corp., bets that were granted confidential status and not revealed in a third-quarter regulatory filing, according to an updated document released Tuesday. The Apple stake reduction left Berkshire with a holding valued at US$120 billion at the end of 2020, according to another filing.</p>\n\n<p>Berkshire spent the last three months of the year revamping its bets on some other sectors. Buffett’s conglomerate cut a few bank holdings, exiting JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and M&amp;T Bank Corp. while slashing its Wells Fargo &amp; Co. stake by 59 per cent. The company also shifted a recent bet on drugmakers by increasing a stake in Merck &amp; Co Inc., Abbvie Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., while exiting a recent investment in Pfizer Inc.</p>\n\n<p>Berkshire also exited a bet on Barrick Gold Corp. The investment was a surprise when it was revealed last year, given Buffett’s years of chiding the precious metal.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/berkshire-trims-apple-bet-reveals-chevron-verizon-holdings-1.1564415\">https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/berkshire-trims-apple-bet-reveals-chevron-verizon-holdings-1.1564415</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/llhfdj/berkshire_trims_apple_bet_reveals_chevron_verizon/","title":"Berkshire trims Apple bet, reveals Chevron, Verizon holdings","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T02:28:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 02:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"llhfdj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/llhfdj/berkshire_trims_apple_bet_reveals_chevron_verizon/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/llhfdj/berkshire_trims_apple_bet_reveals_chevron_verizon/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"rockinoutwith2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rockinoutwith2","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"rockinoutwith2","score":329,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"伯克希尔下调苹果押注，透露雪佛龙、威瑞森持股。","the_new_excerpt":"几天前，在这个子上有一些 \"奇怪 \"的猜测，华伦?\n或许买下了特斯拉......最后变成了Verizon和雪佛龙（呵呵）。\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n巴菲特旗下的伯克希尔哈撒韦公司减持苹果公司...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"伯克希爾下調蘋果押注，透露雪佛龍、威瑞森持股。","the_new_excerpt":"幾天前，在這個子上有一些 \"奇怪 \"的猜測，華倫?\n或許買下了特斯拉......最後變成了Verizon和雪佛龍（呵呵）。\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n巴菲特旗下的伯克希爾哈撒韋公司減持蘋果公司...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lw3no0","excerpt":"The title says it all you autists.
