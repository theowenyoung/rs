From what I&#39;ve read so far - and it makes a lot of sense - I should look into buying low-cost ETF&#39;s. </p>\n\n<p>Now, what I still don&#39;t know is how to choose a good ETF, how many to buy, etc. Since I&#39;m really young, I could pick sum more risky ETF&#39;s, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still important to hold bonds and low risk stocks or ETF&#39;s. Also, I would still like to allocate a percentage of my portfolio to individual stocks, where I would do research about the company and decide what to buy specifically. From what I&#39;ve read here so far 80% ETF&#39;S/20% stock would be good?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcmxym/im_looking_to_learn_about_how_to_create_a/","title":"I'm looking to learn about how to create a diversified portfolio after having gambled away 1500$","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T00:46:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 00:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcmxym","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcmxym/im_looking_to_learn_about_how_to_create_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcmxym/im_looking_to_learn_about_how_to_create_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Biono03","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Biono03","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Biono03","score":199,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我想学习如何在赌掉1500元后建立一个多元化的投资组合。","the_new_excerpt":"我先说一下，是的，我被拉进了GME的炒作中。我知道\n所有，因为它是在40元左右，但只进了300元左右。我还没有卖\n因为我相信，如果我持有进\n长期来看，由于公司将做大的改变，移...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我想學習如何在賭掉1500元后建立一個多元化的投資組合。","the_new_excerpt":"我先說一下，是的，我被拉進了GME的炒作中。我知道\n所有，因爲它是在40元左右，但只進了300元左右。我還沒有賣\n因爲我相信，如果我持有進\n長期來看，由於公司將做大的改變，移...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-llnv2o","excerpt":"What is EHang Technologies:\n\nEHang (Nasdaq: EH) is the world's leading autonomous aerial vehicle technology\nplatform company.
