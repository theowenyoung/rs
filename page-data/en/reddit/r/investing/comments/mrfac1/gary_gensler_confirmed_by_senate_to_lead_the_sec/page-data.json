Both subjects received attention on Capitol Hill this year after January’s wild trading in Game Stop, AMC Entertainment and other stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Gensler also noted potential problems with the current structure of payment for order flow, a common practice on Wall Street whereby trading firms, such as Citadel Securities, pay companies to send them their customers’ orders for execution.</p>\n\n<p>Questioned in March how the SEC should regulate bitcoin and other digital assets, Gensler replied that the responsibility could fall across the government depending on how assets such as bitcoin are classified. One of his earliest and most-anticipated decisions as head of the SEC will be whether to allow the creation of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/gary-gensler-confirmed-to-lead-the-sec.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/gary-gensler-confirmed-to-lead-the-sec.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Gary Gensler also taught the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63UUkfL0onkxF6MYgVa04Fn\">Blockchain and Money</a> course at MIT&#39;s Sloan School.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mrfac1/gary_gensler_confirmed_by_senate_to_lead_the_sec/","title":"Gary Gensler confirmed by Senate to lead the SEC, Wall Street’s top regulator","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"April 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-15T18:17:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-15 18:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mrfac1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mrfac1/gary_gensler_confirmed_by_senate_to_lead_the_sec/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mrfac1/gary_gensler_confirmed_by_senate_to_lead_the_sec/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"megacurl","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/megacurl","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"megacurl","score":168,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ゲイリー・ゲンスラー、ウォール街の最高規制機関であるSECのトップに上院で承認される","the_new_excerpt":"> 証券取引委員会（SEC）のトップに指名されたゲイリー・ゲンスラー氏は、上院の決議を経て\n> 上院は53-45でゲンスラーの指名を承認した。\n> 金融規制当局のトップに指名された。\n> \n> ジョー・バイデン大統領が指名したゲンスラー氏は、今後、証券取引委員会で重要な役割を果たすことになります。\n> ゲンスラーは、今後、金融商品取引法の施行と草案作成において重要な役割を果たすことになる。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"加里-根斯勒被参议院确认领导华尔街最高监管机构美国证券交易委员会（SEC）。","the_new_excerpt":"> 加里-根斯勒将在参议院之后领导证券交易委员会。\n> 周三以53-45的投票结果确认了他领导国家最高领导人的提名。\n> 金融监管机构。\n> \n> 被美国总统乔-拜登选中的Gensler现在将扮演重要角色\n> 在执行和起草...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"加里-根斯勒被參議院確認領導華爾街最高監管機構美國證券交易委員會（SEC）。","the_new_excerpt":"> 加里-根斯勒將在參議院之後領導證券交易委員會。\n> 週三以53-45的投票結果確認了他領導國家最高領導人的提名。\n> 金融監管機構。\n> \n> 被美國總統喬-拜登選中的Gensler現在將扮演重要角色\n> 在執行和起草...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mrhrgv","excerpt":"\"In Amazon’s 1997 letter to shareholders, our first, I talked about our hope to\ncreate an “enduring franchise,” one that would reinvent what it means to serve\ncustomers by unlocking the internet’s power.
