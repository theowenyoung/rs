I&#39;ve heard multiple versions of the story about how these work, all of which go something like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>To execute a short ladder attack, two bearish hedge funds trade shares of stock back and forth between each other at lower and lower prices in order to create the illusion that the price is dropping and scare owners into panic selling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>The TL;DR here is that short ladder attacks don&#39;t exist.</strong> Due to the way the market is structured, activity like the kind described above can&#39;t affect prices in even the short run. To explain why, I&#39;ll first need to explain how the exchanges match up orders to execute trades.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The order book</strong></p>\n\n<p>For every stock listed on major exchanges, there is a list of requests to buy a stock at a price (called bid orders) and a similar list of requests to sell (called ask orders). A typical bid order says something like &quot;I&#39;m willing to buy 100 shares of company ABC at $10.00 per share&quot;, and a typical ask order says something like &quot;I&#39;m willing to sell 15 shares of ABC at $10.05 per share&quot;. Exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ collect these orders into a list and sort them by price, so that the highest bid price and the lowest ask price sit on top of the respective sides of the order book. The difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask prices is called the spread.</p>\n\n<p>For example, let&#39;s say that the two example orders above are the highest bid and lowest ask orders for ABC. If someone submits a market sell order of 20 shares of ABC, they will have the entire order executed at $10.00 per share. The bid price will remain at $10.00 per share, but there are now only 80 shares available at that price. If someone places a market buy order form 20 shares of ABC, they will have 15 shares executed at $10.05 and 5 shares executed at the next lowest ask price. This would widen the spread for ABC. If you place a limit buy order for 20 shares of ABC at $9.95 per share, this would go in the order book under the bid of $10.00, and you won&#39;t get your order filled until all shares listed for sale at $10.00 are sold first.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the highest volume traders are called &quot;market makers&quot;. They place both bid and ask orders around recently traded prices and hope to make money buy collecting the spread. They can lose money if the movement in price is bigger than the spread, so spreads are typically wider for more volatile names. High frequency traders make money by looking at the structure of the order book and the order flow and using algorithms to predict which way it will move.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The NBBO and the SIP</strong></p>\n\n<p>NBBO stands for National Best Bid/Offer, and refers to the highest bid price and lowest ask price across all exchanges. According to SEC rules, any broker must execute their client&#39;s buy orders at the lowest ask price and the sell orders at the highest bid price. Quotes of the NBBO and records of trade prices and volume are broadcast on SIP (Security Information Processes) feeds, which all executing brokers are listening too so that they can make informed decisions about the market.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why short attacks can&#39;t really work</strong></p>\n\n<p>With this much information about the market being broadcast, the type of short attack described above is impossible. If potential short attackers executed a trade at a price lower than the national best bid, everyone listening to the SIP feed would know about it and their illegal activity would be extremely obvious. Certainly, whoever owned the bid at the top of the book would be pretty annoyed, since a worse buy order just got filled.</p>\n\n<p>And even if they don&#39;t wind up getting in trouble for it, the best bid price is still sitting there waiting to be filled by a sell order. Any broker executing a retail sell order would have to execute at the best available bid price according to the NBBO rules. And any market maker or high frequency trader will see what&#39;s happening and should know to ignore it.</p>\n\n<p>The only way these shorters could actually drive the price down would be to burn through the entire buy side of the order book until they reach some target price. This can move the price down, but typically it gets harder and harder the further you get into the order book. High frequency traders and day trading algorithms would also be able to catch on and start placing bids so they can buy at these artificially low prices, and the impact of the short trade will decay over time. As a result, the bears would have increased the amount of short they needed to cover without moving the price all that much, and they&#39;ll have lost some money in the process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what causes market crashes like GME had on 1/29?</strong></p>\n\n<p>For a crash like this to happen, sellers need to cross the spread to get their sells filled faster than the buy side of the book can replenish, causing the buy side of the book to thin out and vanish until it regains support at a lower level. This is basically order book speak for &quot;a lot more people wanted to sell than buy&quot;. Beyond that it&#39;s hard to figure out exactly what happened, but it was probably a combination of some of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Market makers had bought enough of GME that they didn&#39;t want to risk buying more and/or got a sell signal, so they pulled or lowered their bids</li>\n<li>Bid side support from retail investors thinned or vanished after some brokers locked them out from buying more</li>\n<li>Bid side support from previous shorts like Melvin thinned or vanished as shorts finished up covering their positions</li>\n<li>New investors opened up short positions if they felt GME was overpriced</li>\n<li>Some retail traders who rode the wave up took a profit at the perceived peak</li>\n<li>As the price began to fall, retailers who bought on margin were forced to liquidate at market price (the exact opposite of a short squeeze)</li>\n<li>As the price began to fall, long investors panicked and sold</li>\n<li>As the price began to fall, sellers of options decreased their stake used to hedge as option delta decreased (a downward gamma squeeze)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Anyone who sold at the top of this crash probably contributed to the decline, but that doesn&#39;t make it market manipulation. If a trader of any kind looked at the order book, decided the buy side was thin, and sold, that&#39;s just a good trade.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, the notion of a short ladder attack is completely made up. Not only is it technically infeasible, but <a href=\"https://www.truthorfiction.com/what-is-a-short-ladder-attack/\">there was little to no mention of it anywhere on the web just a couple weeks ago</a>. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s just an excuse that bulls invented and parroted when prophecies of price spikes didn&#39;t come true.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/","title":"The Myth of the Short Ladder Attack","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T17:26:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 17:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lbib0x","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"EmptySet2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/EmptySet2","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"EmptySet2","score":195,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"短梯攻击的神话","the_new_excerpt":"对冲基金通过降低某些股票的价格的想法。\n协调的 \"短梯攻击 \"已经在reddit上的所有过去的夫妇\n天。我听过多个版本的故事，关于这些工作原理，所有的\n其中的内容是这样的。\n\n> 要执行短梯攻击，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"短梯攻擊的神話","the_new_excerpt":"對沖基金通過降低某些股票的價格的想法。\n協調的 \"短梯攻擊 \"已經在reddit上的所有過去的夫婦\n天。我聽過多個版本的故事，關於這些工作原理，所有的\n其中的內容是這樣的。\n\n> 要執行短梯攻擊，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lk688l","excerpt":"So I was listening to an interview with Howard Marks & Joel Greenblatt, called\n\"Is It Different This Time?\" (google it if you haven't, its fantastic) and one\nof Joel's talking points about the euphoria we've reached in the stock markets\nis that:\n\n * He took the 100 least profitable companies in 2019…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lk688l/is_now_the_time_to_jump_ship_50_of_nysenasdaq/","title":"Is now the time to jump ship? 50% of NYSE/NASDAQ equities posted a TTM EPS <0","date":"February 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"现在是跳槽的时候了吗？50%的纽交所/纳斯达克股票公布的TTM每股收益<0元","the_new_excerpt":"所以我在听霍华德-马克斯和乔尔-格林布拉特的采访，叫什么？\n\"这次不一样吗？\" （谷歌它，如果你没有，它的奇妙）和一个\n乔尔的谈话要点，我们已经达到了股市的兴奋感\n是那。\n\n * 他把2019年最不赚钱的100家公司... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"現在是跳槽的時候了嗎？50%的紐交所/納斯達克股票公佈的TTM每股收益<0元","the_new_excerpt":"所以我在聽霍華德-馬克斯和喬爾-格林布拉特的採訪，叫什麼？\n\"這次不一樣嗎？\" （谷歌它，如果你沒有，它的奇妙）和一個\n喬爾的談話要點，我們已經達到了股市的興奮感\n是那。\n\n * 他把2019年最不賺錢的100家公司... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lk8cu2","excerpt":"Started \"investing\" ~6 months back due to covid lockdowns and having nothing\nbetter to do, I have not invested prior to this.
