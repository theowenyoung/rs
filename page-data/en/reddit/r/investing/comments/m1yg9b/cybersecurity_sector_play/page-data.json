Given recents events, such as the SolarWinds and Microsoft hacks, this play seems like a no-brainer.  </p>\n\n<p>Governments will need to continue to ramp up spending to guard national interests and security. Cybersecurity has been elevated to a societal level risk. Corporations will also need to spend a significant amount of capital to guard trade secrets, technology, and customer trust. </p>\n\n<p>COVID has also significantly increased digital work exposure with remote work. Additionally, corporations have greatly expanded their digital platforms during the pandemic, leaving their networks even more vulnerable. </p>\n\n<p>The Cybersecurity market has outperformed the broader market in the past year (past performance not indicative of future results yada yada) and is expected to have compounding annual growth of 10% through 2027. I don’t see any situation in which cyberattack frequency decreases in the coming years, and believe we will be in a full blown digital Cold War with China soon (if we aren’t already). </p>\n\n<p>I haven’t seen much discussion on this topic from the sub, so I’d love to hear thoughts , as well as any bear cases.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: grammar</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Getting a lot of comments regarding individual cybersecurity companies. My thesis is based on broad sector performance, and I&#39;m not planning on picking individual holdings. The industry is rapid-moving and relatively young, so the risk associated with trying to pick winners is high. I am betting on the industry as a whole with a 5-10 year time horizon.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m1yg9b/cybersecurity_sector_play/","title":"Cybersecurity Sector Play","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-10T16:20:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-10 16:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m1yg9b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m1yg9b/cybersecurity_sector_play/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m1yg9b/cybersecurity_sector_play/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"crediblepidgeon","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/crediblepidgeon","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"crediblepidgeon","score":90,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"网络安全领域玩法","the_new_excerpt":"想把我投资组合中的一小部分投入到宽行业ETF中。\nBUG、IHAK、CIBR等）。鉴于最近发生的事件，如SolarWinds和。\n微软黑客，这一出似乎是不折不扣的。\n\n各国政府需要继续加大支出，以守护国家的。\n兴趣和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"網絡安全領域玩法","the_new_excerpt":"想把我投資組合中的一小部分投入到寬行業ETF中。\nBUG、IHAK、CIBR等）。鑑於最近發生的事件，如SolarWinds和。\n微軟黑客，這一出似乎是不折不扣的。\n\n各國政府需要繼續加大支出，以守護國家的。\n興趣和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-mdyvh8","excerpt":"Some of you all might be disappointed that we didn't have a crazy bull day like\nyesterday.
