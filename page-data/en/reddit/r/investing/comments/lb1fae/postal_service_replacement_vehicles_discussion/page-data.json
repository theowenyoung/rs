They then went into how they’ll be replaced and the ~6 billion dollar contract that comes with them. Currently it’s narrowed down to 3 finalists but has been postponed due to COVID-19. The final 3 companies/ partnerships are Workhorse Group ($WKHS), Karsan and Morgan Olson ($KRSOF &amp; no ticker found for Morgan Olson), and Oshkosh and Ford ($OSK &amp; $F respectively.) I wanted to start a discussion on this and get some other peoples views on investment opportunities. Supposedly, a decision is expected to come out soon. </p>\n\n<p>With the big push towards EV vehicles I feel like workhorse has the best shot. Ford and Oshkosh are going with a regular gas engine while the other 2 manufacturers are going EV/ Hybrid. </p>\n\n<p>Not sure if someone has brought this up already if not and I’m sorry if I missed it. </p>\n\n<p>Info:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2020/12/01/postal-service-delays-mail-truck-replacement-contract-again/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2020/12/01/postal-service-delays-mail-truck-replacement-contract-again/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hammerlanelegends.com/news/us-postal-service-to-award-63b-contract-for-new-mail-truck-this-year-see-the-finalists\">https://www.hammerlanelegends.com/news/us-postal-service-to-award-63b-contract-for-new-mail-truck-this-year-see-the-finalists</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/RE5FGyq12ds\">https://youtu.be/RE5FGyq12ds</a> (Donut Media video)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2021/01/wkhs-stock-no-shoo-in-for-usps-contract/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2021/01/wkhs-stock-no-shoo-in-for-usps-contract/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/05/usps-karsan-hybrid-mail-truck/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/05/usps-karsan-hybrid-mail-truck/amp/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/amp/\">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/amp/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lb1fae/postal_service_replacement_vehicles_discussion/","title":"Postal Service Replacement Vehicles- Discussion","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T02:47:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 02:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lb1fae","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb1fae/postal_service_replacement_vehicles_discussion/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb1fae/postal_service_replacement_vehicles_discussion/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"jk-phill","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jk-phill","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"jk-phill","score":61,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"邮政服务更换车辆-讨论","the_new_excerpt":"我看到了一个视频，从甜甜圈媒体关于如何过时的当前美国邮政的交付。\n车辆是。然后，他们进入了他们将如何替换和约60亿的\n元的合同，与他们。目前，它的范围缩小到3\n决赛选手，但由于COVID-19的原因被推迟。最后的3...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"郵政服務更換車輛-討論","the_new_excerpt":"我看到了一個視頻，從甜甜圈媒體關於如何過時的當前美國郵政的交付。\n車輛是。然後，他們進入了他們將如何替換和約60億的\n元的合同，與他們。目前，它的範圍縮小到3\n決賽選手，但由於COVID-19的原因被推遲。最後的3...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ljja03","excerpt":"I feel this post was necessary due to all the people I saw on here recently\ntalking about money they lost.\n\n\n\nMy Guide on HOW TO ANALYZE & RESEARCH A STOCK/ How to do a thorough due\ndiligence/ DD [Due Diligence 101]:\n\nHere are the things I look at when evaluating a stock.
