The Mises Institute reported a record setting 38.6% year over year money supply growth (source <a href=\"https://mises.org/\">mises.org</a>) as of January 2021. Quite inflationary when one considers this supply growth is normally -0.5 to +2%.</p>\n\n<p>But now we have a second stimulus, with no Mises report yet on what happens 6 months from now with this $1.9 Tril. I will take a shot at it assuming that money is also not coming from a budgeted tax base.</p>\n\n<p>The M2 money supply is now $19395 billion (source <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/\">tradingeconomics.com</a>). $1.9 Tril is 1900 bil.</p>\n\n<p>1.386 x ( 1900 + 19395) / 19395 = 1.5218</p>\n\n<p>So this is a double stimulus giant 52.2% increase in money supply in a short time (year plus some weeks). Stimulus has been done before but never to this scale.</p>\n\n<p>This would redefine gold to be fundamentally higher across people&#39;s value systems. You know the old &quot;you can&#39;t print more gold&quot; saying. Absorbing this factor into mining costs to be higher, at $987 x 1.522 = $1,502 an ounce</p>\n\n<p>This I would argue is the absolute justifiable floor for gold going forward.</p>\n\n<p>Track gold with symbol GC00 (number zeros, not capital letter O&#39;s) is about $1700 an ounce as of 3/6/21.</p>\n\n<p>So we are 1700/1502 = 1.132 so only 13% above this floor</p>\n\n<p>Contrast with silver, which has all in cost of $12.8 an ounce in 2020. Silver at kitco is $25.22 3/6/21, so using the same logic 25.22 / (12.8 x 1.522) = 1.29 or 29% above this floor.</p>\n\n<p>In Feb 2020 we were right before the Big Print(s) and gold was trading at $1650 an ounce. If the same &quot;I want it&quot; vs &quot;I don&#39;t want it&quot; balance returns, this would set gold to</p>\n\n<p>$1650 x 1.522 = $2,511 an ounce</p>\n\n<p>After a big stimulus, gold has historically decoupled from bond effects for a while, going higher. See 2009 to 2010 history.</p>\n\n<p>Back to now. Indeed gold shot to $2000 an ounce ish after the first stimulus by August 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Oil is priced higher again, clearly an upward push on inflation as well.</p>\n\n<p>I am not a total precious metals fan across the board. Palladium is used primarily for the catalytic convertors of gasoline powered cars, and so with the rise of EVs that metal doesn&#39;t have a future with me personally.</p>\n\n<p>But look at what gold is used for. 78% of gold is used in jewelry (source <a href=\"https://goldprice.com/\">goldprice.com</a>). COVID-19 has put barriers in front of young people of marriage age forming relationships. According to <a href=\"https://greenvillebusinessmag.com/\">greenvillebusinessmag.com</a>, 63% of couples have delayed their weddings. A lot of times you shop for the ring first before you plan the wedding, but that is the USA practice. The issue is global. The main point is the delay in relationship formation is a force ahead in time of gold ring buying (or any jewelry for that matter).</p>\n\n<p>So in summary you have a case for a $2,511 price due to record stimulus alone and are adding a huge backlog to the demand onto that. There are people out there saying &quot;Gold is safety, and I don&#39;t need safety right now&quot;. Understood. However, you take the fact that gold is down in price and the tendency to break from the hold of bond&#39;s influence just after a stimulus and I would argue that you have a hell of a setup for gold to go up from this point !</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading !</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lzqqu6/oh_what_a_setup_for_gold_bring_your_calculator/","title":"Oh what a setup for gold !
