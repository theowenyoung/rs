Our revised statement shares many features with its predecessor. For example, we have not changed our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal. However, we did make some key changes. Regarding our employment goal, we emphasize that maximum employment is a broad and inclusive goal. This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for low- and moderate-income communities. In addition, we state that our policy decisions will be informed by our “assessments of shortfalls of employment from its maximum level” rather than by “deviations from its maximum level.” This change means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market. Regarding our price stability goal, we state that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. This means that, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. With this change, we aim to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent goal. Well-anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation goals, particularly in the current low interest rate environment in which our main policy tool is likely to be more frequently constrained by the lower bound.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sounds like they are staying the course and aren&#39;t planning to raise rates for quite awhile. Market looks to stay fat for a bit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lqlqbm/fed_chair_powells_prepared_remarks_to_congress/","title":"Fed Chair Powell's prepared remarks to Congress, Feb. 23, 2021","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T18:13:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 18:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lqlqbm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqlqbm/fed_chair_powells_prepared_remarks_to_congress/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lqlqbm/fed_chair_powells_prepared_remarks_to_congress/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"DavidsWorkAccount","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DavidsWorkAccount","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DavidsWorkAccount","score":192,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"2021年2月23日，美联储主席鲍威尔向国会发表的准备讲话。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-powell-text/fed-chair-powells-prepared-remarks-to-congress-feb-23-2021-idUSKBN2AN1LT\n\n>正如2月份货币政策报告中所述，8月份，该委员会\n> 一致通过了经修订的《关于长期目标和货币的声明》。\n> 政策...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年2月23日，美聯儲主席鮑威爾向國會發表的準備講話。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-powell-text/fed-chair-powells-prepared-remarks-to-congress-feb-23-2021-idUSKBN2AN1LT\n\n>正如2月份貨幣政策報告中所述，8月份，該委員會\n> 一致通過了經修訂的《關於長期目標和貨幣的聲明》。\n> 政策...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m12usw","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m12usw/good_morning_from_germany/","title":"Good morning from Germany! 💎","date":"March 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"早上好，来自德国 💎","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"早上好，來自德國 💎","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m15qeo","excerpt":"-Ten yr treasury note at 1.15 as nasdaq/tech/growth stocks decline feb 12\n\n-steady rise in t note rate, touches 1.6 as of last few days.
