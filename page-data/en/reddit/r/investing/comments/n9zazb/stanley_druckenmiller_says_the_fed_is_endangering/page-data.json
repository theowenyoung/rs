That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.</p>\n\n<p>“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.</p>\n\n<p>“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.</p>\n\n<p>One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.</p>\n\n<p>Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”</p>\n\n<p>However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.</p>\n\n<p>Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.</p>\n\n<p>“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”</p>\n\n<p>Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.</p>\n\n<p>The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.</p>\n\n<p>Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/stanley-druckenmiller-says-the-fed-is-endangering-the-dollars-global-reserve-status.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/stanley-druckenmiller-says-the-fed-is-endangering-the-dollars-global-reserve-status.html</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/n9zazb/stanley_druckenmiller_says_the_fed_is_endangering/","title":"Stanley Druckenmiller says the Fed is endangering the dollar’s global reserve status","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"May 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-11T16:46:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-11 16:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"n9zazb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n9zazb/stanley_druckenmiller_says_the_fed_is_endangering/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n9zazb/stanley_druckenmiller_says_the_fed_is_endangering/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"megacurl","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/megacurl","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"megacurl","score":164,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"スタンレー・ドラッケンミラー氏、FRBはドルの世界的な基軸の地位を危うくしていると語る","the_new_excerpt":" * FRBの政策は、米国のドルの長期的な健全性を脅かすことになるかもしれません。\n   投資界の大物、スタンリー・ドラッケンミラー氏がCNBCに語った。\n * 「歴史上、金融・財政政策が経済とこれほど乖離していた時代は見当たらない。\n   歴史上、金融・財政政策が経済状況とこれほどまでに乖離していた時代は、一度もありません」。\n   の会長兼CEO。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"斯坦利-德鲁肯米勒说美联储正在危及美元的全球储备地位","the_new_excerpt":" * 美联储的政策可能最终威胁到美国的长期健康。\n   投资巨头斯坦利-德鲁肯米勒(Stanley Druckenmiller)告诉CNBC。\n * 我找不到历史上任何一个时期的货币和财政政策有如此大的偏差。\n   与经济形势如此脱节的时期，没有之一，\"这位主席兼首席执行官说。\n   的主席兼首席执行官。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"斯坦利-德魯肯米勒說美聯儲正在危及美元的全球儲備地位","the_new_excerpt":" * 美聯儲的政策可能最終威脅到美國的長期健康。\n   投資巨頭斯坦利-德魯肯米勒(Stanley Druckenmiller)告訴CNBC。\n * 我找不到歷史上任何一個時期的貨幣和財政政策有如此大的偏差。\n   與經濟形勢如此脫節的時期，沒有之一，\"這位主席兼首席執行官說。\n   的主席兼首席執行官。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-n9xe0d","excerpt":"There has been quite a bit of talk on various portfolios like Ray Dalio's all\nweather portfolio or the 100 year \"dragon\" portfolio and they all have a\ncomponent of commodities (or trend)\n\nBut lets say I didn't want to invest in a fund that uses rolling future\ncontracts to gain exposure but invest in…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/n9xe0d/what_is_the_best_way_to_gain_exposure_to/","title":"What is the best way to gain exposure to commodities with out using futures (investing in producers)","date":"May 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"先物を使わずに商品のエクスポージャーを得るにはどうすればよいか（生産者への投資）。","the_new_excerpt":"レイ・ダリオのオールウェザー・ポートフォリオや100年ポートフォリオなど、さまざまなポートフォリオが話題になっています。\nレイ・ダリオのオールウェザー・ポートフォリオや100年ドラゴン・ポートフォリオなど、様々なポートフォリオが話題になっています。\nコモディティ（またはトレンド）の要素を持っています。\n\nしかし、例えば、ローリング・フューチャー・コントラクトを使ってエクスポージャーを得るファンドに投資するのではなく、次のようなものに投資したいとします。\nしかし、例えば、ローリング・フューチャー・コントラクトを使ってエクスポージャーを得るファンドには投資せず、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在不使用期货的情况下，获得商品风险的最佳方式是什么（投资于生产商）？","the_new_excerpt":"有很多关于各种投资组合的讨论，如雷-达利奥的全天候投资组合或百年 \"龙 \"投资组合。\n的全天候投资组合或100年的 \"龙 \"投资组合，它们都有一个\n商品（或趋势）的组成部分\n\n但是，假设我不想投资于一个使用滚动期货合约的基金，而是投资于\n合同来获得风险，而是投资于...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在不使用期貨的情況下，獲得商品風險的最佳方式是什麼（投資於生產商）？","the_new_excerpt":"有很多關於各種投資組合的討論，如雷-達利奧的全天候投資組合或百年 \"龍 \"投資組合。\n的全天候投資組合或100年的 \"龍 \"投資組合，它們都有一個\n商品（或趨勢）的組成部分\n\n但是，假設我不想投資於一個使用滾動期貨合約的基金，而是投資於\n合同來獲得風險，而是投資於...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-n9xndw","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9xndw/i_bought_more_i_will_buy_more/","title":"I bought more.
