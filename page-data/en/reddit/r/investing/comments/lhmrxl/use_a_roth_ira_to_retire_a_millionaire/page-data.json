For most people, it&#39;s absolutely the best vehicle to use for growth. Max it out each year and don&#39;t take any out until retirement.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, let&#39;s say you&#39;re 30. You have 30+ years to retirement. If markets behave as they have on average, your portfolio should double more than 4 times over that time. If you were in a traditional IRA, that 1600%+ growth would be taxed at your tax rate in retirement when you take it out with distributions. If you invested in a Roth IRA, all that growth is yours to keep, tax free.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s an example using <a href=\"https://www.investingfees.com/calc/investment/\">this calculator</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Start with $10,000. Invest an additional $6,000 each year. Earn 10% each year (a <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/average-stock-market-return/\">reasonable</a> <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/average-stock-market-return\">estimate</a> for long term returns). Repeat for 30 years. At the end of 30 years, you&#39;ll have invested $190,000. You&#39;ll have accumulated $<strong>1,161,458.16</strong>. If you used a traditional IRA, you would have saved some taxes on that $190,000 you put in, however you&#39;ll be paying tax on all the gains when you take the money out. If you used a Roth, you would enjoy that $1,161,458 tax free in retirement. It&#39;s worth noting inflation will reduce the buying power of that sweet $1M+...all the more reason to be invested and keep all the growth you can get.</p>\n\n<p>Where to invest if you&#39;re just starting out? I&#39;d suggest Vanguard with a low-cost index ETF like &quot;VTI.&quot; Young and/or want to take on more risk in hopes of higher returns? Consider putting a portion in ETF&#39;s like VGT, ARKK, QCLN, or any other sectors you think will outperform the market.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps. Get your kids to start a Roth as soon as they have a job. Compound growth were the first words I tried to teach my kids. I was still happy with &quot;dada.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhmrxl/use_a_roth_ira_to_retire_a_millionaire/","title":"Use a Roth IRA to retire a millionaire","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T16:36:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 16:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lhmrxl","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhmrxl/use_a_roth_ira_to_retire_a_millionaire/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhmrxl/use_a_roth_ira_to_retire_a_millionaire/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"SeanVo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SeanVo","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"SeanVo","score":1249,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"用Roth IRA让你退休后成为百万富翁","the_new_excerpt":"如果您在美国，Roth IRA允许您投资税后资金（即\n钱，已经坐在你的银行账户， 你已经支付的税款\n通过您的雇主），然后它成长为免税的，并可以取出来。\n退休免税。对于大多数人来说，这绝对是最好的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"用Roth IRA讓你退休後成爲百萬富翁","the_new_excerpt":"如果您在美國，Roth IRA允許您投資稅後資金（即\n錢，已經坐在你的銀行賬戶， 你已經支付的稅款\n通過您的僱主），然後它成長爲免稅的，並可以取出來。\n退休免稅。對於大多數人來說，這絕對是最好的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lsc5ji","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsc5ji/gme_megathread_part_2_for_thursday_february_25th/","title":"GME Megathread Part 2 for Thursday, February 25th, 2021","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"2021年2月25日星期四GME Megathread Part 2","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年2月25日星期四GME Megathread Part 2","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lruvew","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lruvew/absolutely_not_a_cat_on_the_way_to_the_moon/","title":"Absolutely not a cat on the way to the moon 🚀🙏","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 25, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"绝对不是猫在去月球的路上🚀🙏","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"絕對不是貓在去月球的路上🚀🙏","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lhmrxl","previousId":"RedditPost-lsc5ji","nextId":"RedditPost-lruvew","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhmrxl/use_a_roth_ira_to_retire_a_millionaire/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
