We’ve just got to get quicker, better, faster. ... As you look at what we’ve done, you’d say we’ve done a good job, but the other people have done a good job, too.”  </p>\n\n<p>Dimon’s blunt assessment was in response to questions from analysts including Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo who pointed out that with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/disruptors-paypal-and-square-surpass-wall-street-giants-including-goldman-sachs-in-market-cap.html\">rich, tech-like valuations</a>, fintech players have “trounced” the traditional banks in recent years.  </p>\n\n<p>Dimon said he sent his deputies a list of global competitors, and that PayPal, Square, Stripe, Ant Financial as well as U.S. tech giants including <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN\">Amazon</a>, Apple and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL\">Google</a> were names the bank needs to keep an eye on. The rivals are also clients of JPMorgan’s commercial and investment banking in many cases, he added.  </p>\n\n<p>Competition will be particularly tight in the world of payments, he said: “I expect to see very, very tough, brutal competition in the next 10 years,” Dimon said. “I expect to win, so help me God.”  </p>\n\n<p>Dimon added that in some cases, the new players were “examples of unfair competition” that the bank would do something about eventually. He included players that take advantage of richer debit-card revenue for small banks and firms Dimon accused of not taking precautions against money laundering.  </p>\n\n<p>He specifically called out Plaid, the payments start-up whose acquisition by Visa recently collapsed, saying “people who improperly use data that’s been given to them, like Plaid.”  </p>\n\n<p>Plaid CEO Zach Perret declined to directly respond to the accusation during an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/15/plaid-ceo-on-how-its-5-point-3-billion-deal-with-visa-fell-through.html\">interview</a> with CNBC’s David Faber, adding that Plaid is spending time with the bank on a partnership.  </p>\n\n<p>When contacted for further comment, a Plaid spokeswoman said the company is “focused on ensuring people have access to their own financial information so they can securely share it with permission in order to use the fintech apps they choose.”  </p>\n\n<p>She added that “data privacy and security are core to everything we do, including the data exchange agreements we have with JPMorgan Chase among many other banks.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/jamie-dimon-says-jpmorgan-chase-should-absolutely-be-scared-s-less-about-fintech-threat.html\">Original CNBC article</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ky3jty/jamie_dimon_says_jpmorgan_chase_should_absolutely/","title":"Jamie Dimon says JPMorgan Chase should absolutely be ‘scared s---less’ about fintech threat","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T00:04:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 00:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ky3jty","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ky3jty/jamie_dimon_says_jpmorgan_chase_should_absolutely/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ky3jty/jamie_dimon_says_jpmorgan_chase_should_absolutely/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ChocolateTsar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChocolateTsar","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ChocolateTsar","score":1664,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"杰米-戴蒙表示，摩根大通绝对应该对金融科技的威胁 \"不害怕\"。","the_new_excerpt":"> 关键点\n> \n> 杰米-戴蒙对3.4万亿美元银行业巨头管理团队的寄语。\n>摩根大通。害怕金融科技的竞争对手。\n> \n> \"我们绝对不应该害怕，\"Dimon告诉分析师。\n> \n> 迪蒙表示，他给自己的副手发了一份全球竞争对手的名单，并...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"傑米-戴蒙表示，摩根大通絕對應該對金融科技的威脅 \"不害怕\"。","the_new_excerpt":"> 關鍵點\n> \n> 傑米-戴蒙對3.4萬億美元銀行業巨頭管理團隊的寄語。\n>摩根大通。害怕金融科技的競爭對手。\n> \n> \"我們絕對不應該害怕，\"Dimon告訴分析師。\n> \n> 迪蒙表示，他給自己的副手發了一份全球競爭對手的名單，並...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1355199119502008323","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1355199119502008323","title":"ROBINHOOD GIVES ANGERED EMPLOYEES $40 DOORDASH GIFT CARDS TO SATIATE THEIR RAGE *\n\n(Not satire)\n\n$DASH","date":"January 29, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"ROBINHOOD向愤怒的员工赠送40美元DOORDASH礼品卡，以满足他们的愤怒*。\n\n(不是讽刺)\n\n$DASH","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"ROBINHOOD向憤怒的員工贈送40美元DOORDASH禮品卡，以滿足他們的憤怒*。\n\n(不是諷刺)\n\n$DASH","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-l7datt","excerpt":"With all the hullabaloo about GME and other meme stocks, this kinda flew under\nthe radar.
