Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.</p>\n\n<p>- Wood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock’s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock’s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another.</p>\n\n<p>- The portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF’s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682\">materially impacting</a> their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn’t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.</p>\n\n<p>- Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio’s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.</p>\n\n<p>-To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock’s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mij0s2/arkk_morningstar_review_unrestrained_unaware_and/","title":"ARKK Morningstar review: Unrestrained, Unaware, and Unconcerned","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"April 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-03T10:58:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-03 10:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"mij0s2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mij0s2/arkk_morningstar_review_unrestrained_unaware_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mij0s2/arkk_morningstar_review_unrestrained_unaware_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Suspicious_Tension82","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Suspicious_Tension82","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Suspicious_Tension82","score":88,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ARKK晨星点评。无拘无束，不知不觉，无所顾忌。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1031702/ark-innovations-thematic-approach-is-ill-prepared-for-a-major-twist\n\n这方面的很多内容已经被熊洞等地方所覆盖，但是...\n这里有一些亮点。\n\n- 这支队伍的集体经验似乎明显比...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARKK晨星點評。無拘無束，不知不覺，無所顧忌。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1031702/ark-innovations-thematic-approach-is-ill-prepared-for-a-major-twist\n\n這方面的很多內容已經被熊洞等地方所覆蓋，但是...\n這裏有一些亮點。\n\n- 這支隊伍的集體經驗似乎明顯比...","locale":"zh-Hant"},{"title":"ARKKモーニングスターレビュー 無節操・無自覚・無頓着","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1031702/ark-innovations-thematic-approach-is-ill-prepared-for-a-major-twist\n\nこの分野の多くはThe Bear Caveなどですでに取り上げられていますが\nここではその一部を紹介します。\n\n- このチームの集合的な経験は、......というよりも、かなり限られているようだ。","locale":"ja-JA"},{"title":"ARKKモーニングスターレビュー 無節操・無自覚・無頓着","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1031702/ark-innovations-thematic-approach-is-ill-prepared-for-a-major-twist\n\nこの分野の多くはThe Bear Caveなどですでに取り上げられていますが\nここではその一部を紹介します。\n\n- このチームの集合的な経験は、......というよりも、かなり限られているようだ。","locale":"ja"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1388626103690989574","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1388626103690989574","title":"Warren Buffett warns investors not to gamble on stocks https://t.co/pdBe9JIxDP","date":"May 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"TweetJson","localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"ウォーレン・バフェット氏、投資家に株のギャンブルをしないよう警告 https://t.co/pdBe9JIxDP","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"沃伦-巴菲特警告投资者不要在股票上赌博 https://t.co/pdBe9JIxDP","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"沃倫-巴菲特警告投資者不要在股票上賭博 https://t.co/pdBe9JIxDP","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-n34we7","excerpt":"The stock market has been crazy over the last few years, and everyone keeps\ntalking about high-fliers like Tesla and other companies that have increased\ntheir market cap by 800%+ in the last year or so.
