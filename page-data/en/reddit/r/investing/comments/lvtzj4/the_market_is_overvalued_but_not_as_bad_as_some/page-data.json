Mapping trends during a peak is risky, this graph would look a lot different after a major correction.</p>\n\n<p>In general we&#39;re still a ways off the insanity of the dotcom boom. With only good news coming out short term with stimulus and countries opening back up post covid I don&#39;t see a crash soon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you time the market to buy low sell high?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/DksC60V\">https://imgur.com/a/DksC60V</a></p>\n\n<p>Not easily.</p>\n\n<p>The above graph (orange line) represents selling stocks when PE multiples are 3 above the trend and buying back in when PE multiples are below 3. You can see you massively underperform, that&#39;s before we even count missed dividends. You can find very specific numbers that give you a greater return, but they only work on one specific crash and ofter have you sitting out huge periods that&#39;d cost too much in lost dividends.</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s possible to reduce losses during downturns through adjustments, but it&#39;s not as easy as looking at one number.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lvtzj4/the_market_is_overvalued_but_not_as_bad_as_some/","title":"The market is overvalued but not as bad as some say","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T23:48:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 23:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvtzj4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvtzj4/the_market_is_overvalued_but_not_as_bad_as_some/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvtzj4/the_market_is_overvalued_but_not_as_bad_as_some/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ini0n","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ini0n","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ini0n","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"市场被高估了，但并不像有些人说的那么糟糕。","the_new_excerpt":"这里有很多关于PE比率和大萧条水平的讨论。\n的高估。如果我们把下面的PE10绘制成图，就可以看到历史趋势。\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kgaQCY3\n\n我们是不是要再来一次大萧条？\n\n也许不会。\n\n我们可以看到80年代以来强劲的倍数增长，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"市場被高估了，但並不像有些人說的那麼糟糕。","the_new_excerpt":"這裏有很多關於PE比率和大蕭條水平的討論。\n的高估。如果我們把下面的PE10繪製成圖，就可以看到歷史趨勢。\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kgaQCY3\n\n我們是不是要再來一次大蕭條？\n\n也許不會。\n\n我們可以看到80年代以來強勁的倍數增長，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m77yw1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m77yw1/_/","title":"😍","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"😍","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"😍","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m765ue","excerpt":"Just wanna point out that VWAGY is really running today.
