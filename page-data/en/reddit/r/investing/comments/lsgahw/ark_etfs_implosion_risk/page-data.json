The risks comes primarily from ARK&#39;s illiquid and very large holdings in small cap companies. ARK is forced to sell its holdings whenever its liquid ETF gets hit with outflows as is especially the case in market downturns. This could force very painful liquidations at unfavorable prices and the ensuing crash goes into a positive feedback loop leading into a death spiral enticing even more outflows and predatory shorts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lsgahw/ark_etfs_implosion_risk/","title":"ARK ETFs implosion risk ------------------------","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T22:26:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 22:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lsgahw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lsgahw/ark_etfs_implosion_risk/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lsgahw/ark_etfs_implosion_risk/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Whiskerfield","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Whiskerfield","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Whiskerfield","score":98,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"ARK ETF内爆风险 ------------------------","the_new_excerpt":"鉴于近期股市的低迷，尤其是科技股的低迷，这很可能会影响股市的发展。\n随着收益率的不断上升，我认为应该谨慎地分享一下\n投资ARK ETF的风险，《熊穴》写得非常好。\n[https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/special-edition-will-ark-invest-blow]....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARK ETF內爆風險 ------------------------","the_new_excerpt":"鑑於近期股市的低迷，尤其是科技股的低迷，這很可能會影響股市的發展。\n隨着收益率的不斷上升，我認爲應該謹慎地分享一下\n投資ARK ETF的風險，《熊穴》寫得非常好。\n[https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/special-edition-will-ark-invest-blow]....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m2ttbz","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2ttbz/checking_gme_every_morning/","title":"Checking GME every morning","date":"March 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"每天早上检查GME","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"每天早上檢查GME","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m33vsq","excerpt":"I know there have been a lot of posts about NOK recently across several\ndifferent subreddits, but I recently did some due diligence on the the stock and\nwanted to share my findings.\n\nI originally had a lot of links in this, but it led to the post getting\nauto-removed.
