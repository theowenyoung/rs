I know that those cannot be predicted, but I cannot help but deep inside feel like the market is being weird right now. With what happened to Tesla, and more and more people finding out about investing and dumping their entire savings into $GME or $TSLE because it will go to the moon for sure.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously we all know it will crash at some point, and rationally I know that there is no point in trying to predict a crash and cashing out. But, that doesn&#39;t make me feel better. Can someone show me some math that will make me more confident?</p>\n\n<p>And honestly, also please tell me why I shouldn&#39;t just invest into the next meme stock - not that I have confidence in WSB, but I do have FOMO when my friends are making thousands. It feels the same when someone won the lottery, but now they are also talking about how smart they are for learning about WSB and following their advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l5wbkd/fomo_and_fear_of_crash_i_know_my_feelings_are_not/","title":"FOMO, and fear of crash.
