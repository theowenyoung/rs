Next, it seems LUV and ALK are already almost fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels.  This leaves me to to consider JBLU for a potential 20% gain in the next 3-6 months at minimum.</p>\n\n<p>Many of us feel like there is a lot of pent up travel demand.  I believe the vast majority of that travel will be domestic and leisure.  JBLU has not depended on international travel or business travel nearly as much as some of it&#39;s competitors.  CEO has stated they are 80% leisure travel as of mid last year. I think this sets it up well.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, they have a fairly new partnership with AAL that was approved by DOT last month despite pressure by United to halt it. - <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-aal-jetblue-partnership-173205155.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-aal-jetblue-partnership-173205155.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Finally, they have a loyal customer base (as does LUV) and were just voted No. 1 in Economy Class, No. 1 in Inflight Entertainment, No. 2 in Business and First Class (for Mint), and No. 2 airline overall. - <a href=\"https://www.10best.com/awards/travel/\">https://www.10best.com/awards/travel/</a></p>\n\n<p>Let me know your thoughts and GLTA!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lli2s5/lots_of_good_news_for_airlines_a_case_for_jblu/","title":"Lots of Good News for Airlines.
