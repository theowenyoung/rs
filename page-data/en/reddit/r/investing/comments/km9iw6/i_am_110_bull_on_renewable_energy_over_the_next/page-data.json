Not the biggest investment in the world but not small by any means. I’m big on anything renewable and have no problem playing the long-term game. I actually prefer it. </p>\n\n<p>How do you all feel about these? </p>\n\n<p>Also, additional opinions I would love from any of you would be your thoughts on Sunrun (RUN), Palantir (PLTR), Canadian Solar (CSIQ), and First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF (FAN). I am very high on all of these over the next 5 years. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance, and I’m still learning along with everyone else. Warren Buffett said, invest in what you know, and it’s better to get a good company at an okay price, than an okay company at a good price. I’m less concerned about the week to week or month to month, and more so confident in renewable energy taking over during the next decade. It’s not a matter of opinion, and it’s not if, but when! </p>\n\n<p>Thanks all and Happy Holidays and Happy New Year.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/km9iw6/i_am_110_bull_on_renewable_energy_over_the_next/","title":"I am 110% bull on renewable energy over the next few years.
