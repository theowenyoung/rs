She noted crypotcurrency as an area of concern for terrorist and criminal financing.</li>\n<li>“I believe the future is likely to bring <strong>low interest rates for a long time</strong>,” she said, adding it is possible for rates to rise.</li>\n<li>“I think we should take these risks very,very seriously. I think <strong>climate change is an existential threat</strong>.”</li>\n<li>“I would be very pleased to take a look” at <strong>issuing longer-term debt</strong>, including a <strong>50-year Treasury bond</strong>, she says.</li>\n<li><strong>Yellen goes on the offensive here over the question of the minimum wage</strong>, saying the latest research shows only “minimal” job losses in states that raised their minimum wage levels.</li>\n<li> Grassley said he’s “closely examining” Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan. He says the plan doesn’t appear to be well targeted and says it’s <strong>important to “focus efforts” on pandemic relief and not enact a “laundry list” of liberal reforms.</strong></li>\n<li>This appears to be a stab at the plans inclusion of a $15 federal minimum wage in the plan.</li>\n<li>She says there would be money for small business, grants to small entrepreneurs, eviction protections, nutrition assistance, paid leave -- all things to help minority communities.</li>\n<li>To <strong>not spend more on pandemic and economic relief would leave the economy worse off</strong>, she said. She said without deficit financing this aid, the economy could have long run problems and “scarring.”</li>\n<li>She says she is concerned that China is investing in electric vehicles and that most of the EV sales are projected to be in China in the coming years.</li>\n<li>Yellen says that they would not seek to roll back the 2017 tax cuts “now” while the economy is still struggling.</li>\n<li>Yellen says <strong>the value of the dollar should be determined by markets, and the U.S. does not seek a weaker currency to gain a competitive advantage.</strong></li>\n<li> Some hedge funds have “dangerous levels of leverage,” Yellen says. </li>\n<li>Grassley says he’s told Yellen that <strong>it would be a “big mistake” to raise taxes on individuals and businesses during a pandemic.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are the most outstanding things that came to me for investing.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>TL;DR MORE STIMULUS, MORE GREEN INVESTMENTS AND POLICIES AND COMPETING WITH CHINA, UPCOMING CRYPTO POLICIES, TAX CUTS ARE HERE TO STAY FOR THE PANDEMIC.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>GOOD LUCK IN INVESTING.
